Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Therapy With Cisplatin Plus Mitomycin C in BRCA1-Mutated Ovarian <font color="#FF0000">Cancer</font>.	Cisplatin and mitomycin C exert high activity towards BRCA1-deficient cells. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of these drugs in hereditary BRCA1-associated ovarian <font color="#FF0000">cancer</font> (OC). Twelve OC patients, who could not be treated by primary debulking surgery owing to extensive tumor spread, were given neoadjuvant cisplatin (100 mg/m) and mitomycin C (10 mg/m) every 4 weeks for 3 (n = 9), 2 (n = 2), or 4 (n = 1) cycles. The decrease of tumor burden and complete surgical cytoreduction were achieved in all patients. Pathologic complete response, defined as the absence of tumor cells in surgically removed tissues, was observed in 2 (17%) of 12 cases. Retrospective analysis of 62 OC in BRCA1 mutation carriers subjected to conventional neoadjuvant chemotherapy schemes revealed 36 objective tumor responses (58%) and 37 instances (60%) of complete cytoreductive surgery; however, none of these patients demonstrated pathologic complete response. The combination of cisplatin plus mitomycin C showed promising results in BRCA1-driven OC and therefore deserves further clinical evaluation.	1109	168	6	110
Fever and Leg Pain: Consider ALL the Diagnoses.	Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood <font color="#FF0000">cancer</font> diagnosed in the United States. The disease causes a decrease in hematopoiesis, so children often present with symptoms related to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Symptoms for this malignancy may have significant overlap with other conditions such as osteomyelitis. Case Report: A 2-year-old male with no significant medical history presented with lower extremity pain and fever. Initial investigations, including imaging and complete blood count, led physicians to diagnose bilateral osteomyelitis. The patient was prescribed a course of antibiotics; however, his symptoms returned. Eventually, a bone marrow aspiration showed CD99 membrane-positive small round blue cell tumors. The patient was diagnosed with ALL. He was successfully treated with chemotherapy and is now in remission. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the importance of a broad differential diagnosis for a child presenting with leg pain and fever.	1012	142	9	10
