Development of a highly sensitive magneto-enzyme lateral flow immunoassay for dengue NS1 detection.	<b>Background:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue infection represents a global health issue of growing importance. Dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) plays a central role in the early detection of the disease. The most common method for NS1 detection is testing by lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) with varying sensitivity. In this study, we present a highly sensitive magneto-enzyme LFIA for prompt diagnosis of dengue. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe have demonstrated the development of a magneto-enzyme LFIA combining super-paramagnetic nanoparticles as labels and Biotin-Streptavidin signal amplification strategy to detect dengue NS1. Factors affecting the test performance including antibody pair, super-paramagnetic nanoparticle size, nitrocellulose membrane type, amounts of detection and capture antibodies, and amounts of Streptavidin-polyHRP were optimized. Analytical sensitivity and cross-reactivity were determined. Clinical performance of the novel assay was evaluated using a panel of 120 clinical sera. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis newly developed assay could detect NS1 of all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be as low as 0.25 ng ml-1 for DENV-1 and DENV-3, 0.1 ng ml-1 for DENV-2, and 1.0 ng ml-1 for DENV-4. The LOD for DENV-2 was a 50-fold improvement over the best values previously reported. There was an absence of cross-reactivity with Zika NS1, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. The sensitivity and specificity of the novel assay were 100% when tested on clinical samples. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe have successfully developed a magneto-enzyme LFIA, allowing rapid and highly sensitive detection of dengue NS1, which is essential for proper management of patients infected with DENV. <br>	1439	792	14
Association of ABO blood groups with dengue fever and its complications in a tertiary care hospital.	<b>CONTEXT:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever (DF) has been steadily increasing in India with outbreaks in certain areas taking the proportion of epidemics. Along with secondary dengue, several risk factors predispose to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Very few studies associating the relationship between dengue and its severity with ABO blood group have been documented. <br><b>AIMS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of this study was to determine the association between distribution of ABO Rh blood groups and DF and DF with thrombocytopenia. <br><b>SETTINGS AND DESIGN:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis was a retrospective descriptive study conducted at the clinical laboratory of the department of microbiology. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue patients whose case record contained information on blood group were screened for details of blood group and confirmed dengue diagnosis. Randomly 384 case records were selected. These were divided into two groups; Group 1 included DF cases (platelet count >20,000) and Group 2 included DF cases with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20,000). Control group consisted of patients other than dengue, whose blood grouping had been done; randomly 390 were selected and analyzed. <br><b>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspP value was calculated using the Chi-square test. Odds ratio were calculated using the Fisher's exact test. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDF was higher in 23% of individuals with AB blood group as compared to 8.5% of controls (P = 0.0004), whereas patients with blood group O were significantly less affected with DF (P = 0.0048). Disease severity was not associated with any of the blood groups. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIndividuals with AB blood group are more prone to DF, whereas individuals with blood group O are less prone. <br>	1331	1310	14
Role of Interleukin-10 and Abdominopelvic Ultrasound as a Potential Predictor of Disease Severity in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever.	Introduction Dengue viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical/subtropical countries. Early and prompt detection of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), though challenging, is helpful to identify an individual that would benefit from intensive therapy. Objective The goal of this study was to determine the plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in DHF patients at four to seven days of disease onset and 24 hours after the first sample. We also aimed to determine the association of plasma IL-10 levels and abdominopelvic ultrasound findings. Methods A total of 50 registered DHF patients aged 15 to 50 years were recruited. Plasma IL-10 concentration measurements and abdominopelvic ultrasounds were performed. Patients were also categorized based on ultrasound grading I to IV (based on severity). Outcomes were described as recovery and shock. Platelet count and hematocrit percentages were also recorded. Results Plasma IL-10 levels were elevated in DHF patients and associated with fatal outcomes (p = 0.00). Binary regression-coefficient showed the direct effect of high levels of plasma IL-10 on the fatal outcome of patients 24 hours after the first sample (p = 0.04). Disease severity was predicted by a positive correlation between ultrasound grades and outcomes (p = 0.00). Spearman's correlation coefficient found a highly significant inverse relationship between plasma IL-10 levels and platelet count after 24 hours (p = 0.01). However, a significant positive relationship was observed between elevated plasma IL-10 levels and hematocrit percentage after 24 hours (p = 0.01). Conclusion Elevated plasma IL-10 levels and abdominopelvic ultrasonography are promising potential predictors of disease progression and fatal outcome in DHF patients. <br>	1526	276	15

Dengue Fever with Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis : Sensorium Imbroglio.	Dengue is the most common arboviral disease affecting many countries worldwide. With endemicity of the disease and huge burden, atypical clinical presentations occur posing high diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Emerging neurological complications in dengue fever are reported in recent past Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune mediated acute demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system following recent infection or vaccination and characterized by multifocal white matter involvement. Early suspicion and diagnosis of such complication is clinical dilemma and it further complicates the clinical scenario. This case report highlights occurrence of such uncommon manifestation of ADEM in commonly occurring dengue fever along with its diagnosis and successful management in a young individual. <br>	720	114	5
Association of dengue virus-specific polyfunctional T-cell responses with clinical disease severity in acute dengue infection.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough the role of dengue virus (DENV)-specific T cells in the pathogenesis of acute dengue infection is emerging, the functionality of virus-specific T cells associated with milder clinical disease has not been well studied. We sought to investigate how the functionality of DENV-NS3 and DENV-NS5 protein-specific T cells differ in patients with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing intracellular cytokine assays, we assessed the production of interferon γ (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), and CD107a expression in adult patients with acute DF (n = 21) and DHF (n = 22). <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspQuadruple cytokine-producing, polyfunctional DENV-NS3- and DENV-NS5-specific T cells were more frequent in those with DF when compared to those with DHF. While DENV-NS3- and DENV-NS5-specific T cells in patients with DF expressed IFNγ > TNF-α > MIP-β > CD107a, T cells of those with DHF predominantly expressed CD107a > MIP-1β > IFNγ > TNF-α. Overall production of IFNγ or TNF-α by DENV-NS3- and DENV-NS5-specific T cells was significantly higher in patients with DF. The majority of NS3-specific T cells in patients with DF (78.6%) and DHF (68.9%) were single-cytokine producers; 76.6% of DENV-NS5-specific T cells in those with DF and 77.1% of those with DHF, produced only a single cytokine. However, no significant association was found with polyfunctional T-cell responses and the degree of viraemia. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur results suggest that the functional phenotype of DENV-specific T cells are likely to associate with clinical disease severity. <br>	1350	767	9
Cross-Reaction, Enhancement, and Neutralization Activity of Dengue Virus Antibodies against Zika Virus: A Study in the Mexican Population.	Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, has quickly spread in many regions around the world where dengue virus (DENV) is endemic. This represents a major health concern, given the high homology between these two viruses, which can result in cross-reactivity. The aim of this study was to determine the cross-reacting antibody response of the IgM and IgG classes against the recombinant envelope protein of ZIKV (rE-ZIKV) in sera from patients with acute-phase infection of different clinical forms of dengue, i.e., dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (before the arrival of ZIKV in Mexico 2010), as well as acute-phase sera of ZIKV patients, together with the implications in neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement. Differences in IgM responses were observed in a number of DF and DHF patients whose sera cross-reacted with the rE-ZIK antigen, with 42% recognition between acute-phase DHF and ZIKV but 27% recognition between DF and ZIKV. Regarding IgG antibodies, 71.5% from the DF group showed cross-reactivity to rE-ZIKV in contrast with 50% and only 25% of DHF and ZIKV serum samples, respectively, which specifically recognized the homologous antigen. The DHF group showed more enhancement of ZIKV infection of FCRγ-expressing cells compared to the DF group. Furthermore, the DHF group also showed a higher cross-neutralizing ability than that of DF. This is the first report where DF and DHF serum samples were evaluated for cross-reactivity against Zika protein and ZIKV. Furthermore, DENV serum samples cross-protect against ZIKV through neutralizing antibodies but at the same time mediate antibody-dependent enhancement in the sequential ZIKV infection. <br>	1459	277	9
Predictors of Major Bleeding and Mortality in Dengue Infection: A Retrospective Observational Study in a Tertiary Care Centre in South India.	We conducted a retrospective observational study to describe the clinical profile and outcomes of patients admitted with a diagnosis of dengue fever in a tertiary hospital in South India. A total of 159 patients admitted from April 2014 to October 2018 were included in the study. Vomiting (70.4%), myalgia (60.4%), headache (42.1%), abdominal pain (38.4%), bleeding (38%), and rash (37.1%) were the most common symptoms at presentation. The mean duration of hospital stay was 4.9 days (SD ± 2.4), and the median cost was INR 19,708 ($285) (IQR INR 12,968-32,056 ($188-$305)). Major bleeding was associated with elevated SGOT and SGPT, severe dengue, and secondary dengue. Mortality was associated with elderly age; elevated total leukocyte count, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, SGOT, and SGPT; and high SOFA score. In view of these observations, we recommend stratifying patients according to the WHO classification of dengue and avoiding the use of thrombocytopenia as a single marker of the severity of the illness. <br>	870	171	7
Serological tests reveal significant cross-reactive human antibody responses to Zika and Dengue viruses in the Mexican population.	Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has caused recent large outbreaks in the Americas. Given its association with severe congenital defects including microcephaly, distinguishing infections caused by ZIKV from those caused by dengue virus (DENV) is of primordial importance. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the recombinant proteins rEIII-ZIKV (Envelope protein domain III) and rNS1ß-leader-ZIKV (non-structural protein 1) for the serological diagnosis of ZIKV in the Mexican population. We also evaluated potential cross-reactivity in commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) based on the ZIKV NS1 and DENV NS1 proteins. rEIII-ZIKV and rNS1ß-leader-ZIKV proteins were tested with sera from 30 PCR-confirmed ZIKV cases, 50 ZIKV-naïve, DENV-exposed subjects with no acute febrile disease, (asymptomatic subjects, AS), and 50 ZIKV-naive and DENV naïve AS. Commercial ELISA tests were evaluated with sera from 57 ZIKV and 20 DENV PCR-confirmed cases, and 50 ZIKV-naïve, DENV-exposed AS. In-house ELISA assays showed that IgM antibody levels against rEIII-ZIKV and rNS1ß-ZIKV were higher in ZIKV naïve, DENV-exposed AS than in acutely infected ZIKV individuals. IgG reactivity was highest for rEIII-ZIKV, and indistinguishable between acutely infected ZIKV cases and DENV exposed AS. Positivity for the Euroimmun Zika IgM assay at 7-10 days was considerably higher in DENV-naïve ZIKV patients (86%) than in DENV-exposed ZIKV patients (33%), while 39% of the latter had false-negative anti-ZIKV IgG before 7 days of onset. DENV-exposed ZIKV patients presented lower anti-ZIKV IgM and higher IgG responses similar to a secondary dengue response. Forty-four percent of DENV- exposed acute ZIKV patients were DENV IgM positive with the Panbio Dengue assay, and two (15%) of the DENV-naïve ZIKV patients presented false DENV IgG conversion. Given the extensive cross-reactivity to both the NS1 and EDIII proteins in current serological methods, the development of sensitive and specific serological tests to distinguish ZIKV from DENV infections is an urgent priority. <br>	1805	338	12
Discovery of 3-Arylquinoxaline Derivatives as Potential Anti-Dengue Virus Agents.	We designed and synthesized a series of novel 3-arylquinoxaline derivatives and evaluated their biological activities as potential dengue virus (DENV) replication inhibitors. Among them, [3-(4-methoxyphenyl)quinoxalin-2-yl](phenyl)methanol (19a), [6,7-dichloro-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)quinoxalin-2-yl](phenyl)methanol (20a), and (4-methoxyphenyl)(3-phenylquinoxalin-2-yl)methanone (21b) were found to significantly inhibit the DENV RNA expression in Huh-7-DV-Fluc cells with a potency better than that of ribavirin. Compound 19a reduced DENV replication in both viral protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited no significant cell cytotoxicity. Notably, compound 19a exhibited a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) value at 1.29 ± 0.74 μM. We further observed that the inhibitory effect of 19a on DENV replication was due to suppression of DENV-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Docking studies also showed that 19a caused hydrophobic interactions at the active sites with Arg29, Glu31, Tyr116, Leu138, Pro139, Lys454, Arg455, and Gln529. The calculated lowest binding energy between the 19a and COX-2 was -9.10 kcal/mol. In conclusion, compound 19a might be a potential lead compound for developing an anti-DENV agent. <br>	1114	201	7
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) modulates host cellular autophagy progression in sub genomic dengue virus-2 replicon cells.	Cellular autophagy (Macrophagy) is a self-degradative process, executed through the network of autophagy associated genes (ATGs) encoded proteins. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that dengue virus (DENV) induces autophagy and supports the viral genome replication and translation. Therefore, the cellular autophagy induced by dengue virus can be a good target for antiviral drug development. The action of mycophenolic acid (MPA), a specific inhibitor of DENV replication, was investigated in the stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells. The inhibition was mediated by enhanced degradation of autophagic substrates in stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells as evidenced by a decrease in lapidated LC3 (LC3II) and p62 expression in the presence of MPA. In contrast, the results indicated that four gene sets, namely Trans membrane protein 74 (TMEM74), Unc-51-like kinase 2 (ULK2), Cathepsin D (CTSD) and Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) were upregulated in stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells, due to the sustained dynamic replication of DENV2 genome. These ATGs involved in the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) formation, were suppressed in the presence MPA. Instead, MPA induced the expression of different set of autophagy genes such as ATG4, AKT1, APP, ATG16L1, ATG16L2, B2M and HPRT1. An enzyme involved in the nucleotide salvage pathway, HPRT1, was highly expressed in the presence of MPA. The study shows that DENV2 replication is dependent on PAS formation and is inhibited in the presence of MPA by enhancing the degradation of autophagic substrates and suppression of PAS formation. This study provides impetus in designing MPA analogues to effectively inhibit dengue viral replication. <br>	1447	262	11
A Study on Cardiac Manifestations of Dengue Fever.	<b>Aims:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIncidence of cardiac involvement in dengue fever varies between 15 -50%. Cardiac manifestations of dengue fever include asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, transient AV blocks, transient ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis and pericardial effusion. This study was done with the objective of finding actual incidence of different cardiac manifestations of dengue fever in our tertiary care hospital. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne hundred and twenty dengue patients were studied between January 2016 to December 2017. Routine biochemical parameters like complete haemogram, liver function tests, renal function tests, electrolytes were checked in all cases. ECG, echocardiography, Troponin T were evaluated in every patients and they were corroborated with clinical features like chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitation. Patients with electrolyte abnormalities, preexisting heart disease, drugs interfering with heart rhythm were excluded from study. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFifteen patients had cardiac involvement (12.5%). Eight patient had bradyarrhythmias (6.6%). Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia was commonest (3.3%). All had normal recovery within two weeks. Four patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 35% - 45%) and there was spontaneous recovery within three months. Two patients had pericardial effusion which resolved within two weeks. Transient 2.1 AV block and atrial fibrillation were observed in two cases. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCardiac manifestations of Dengue were present in 11.4 % of our patents. Brady arrhythmias (6.6%) were commonest manifestation which resolves spontaneously within seven to fourteen days. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was present in 3.3% of patients which recovered within three months. Pericardial effusion was seen in 2.5% of patients. There were no significant tachyarrhythmias in our patients except one case of atrial fibrillation. <br>	1586	707	18

One-step pentaplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for detection of zika, dengue, chikungunya, West nile viruses and a human housekeeping gene.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRecent emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV), and the global spread of dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV) and West Nile viruses (WNV) raised urgent need of accurate and affordable molecular diagnosis of these clinically indistinguishable arboviral infections. <br><b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe established a pentaplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay (CII-ArboViroPlex rRT-PCR) for specific and sensitive detection of the African and American genotypes of ZIKV, all four serotypes of DENV, CHIKV, WNV and a housekeeping gene as internal control in single reaction. <br><b>STUDY DESIGN:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSpecific primers and probe sets were designed for ZIKV, DENV, CHIKV, WNV and RNase P (housekeeping gene) and tested for in-vitro transcribed RNA standards, virus cultures, clinical samples positive for ZIKV, DENV, CHIKV and WNV and limit of detection (LOD) were determined for each. Results Using ten-fold serially diluted in-vitro transcribed RNA, CII- ArboViroPlex rRT-PCR assay has LOD of 100 RNA copies/reaction (Rn) for ZIKV in serum or urine, 100 RNA copies/Rn for DENV in serum, and 10 RNA copies/Rn for CHIKV and WNV in serum. LODs from sera spiked with quantitated viral stocks were 2.6 × 102 GEQ/Rn for ZIKV, 2.2 × 101 GEQ/Rn for DENV-1, 9.4 × 100 GEQ/Rn for DENV-2, 2.3 × 102 GEQ/Rn for DENV-3, 1.4 × 103 GEQ/Rn for DENV-4, 2.7 × 102 GEQ/Rn for CHIKV, and 1.05 × 101 GEQ/Rn for WNV. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe CII-ArboViroPlex rRT-PCR assay is a quantitative one-step pentaplex rRT-PCR assay for the molecular detection and differential diagnosis of ZIKV, DENV, CHIKV, WNV and a human housekeeping gene control in a single- PCR reaction. <br>	1327	714	6
A vector-host model to assess the impact of superinfection exclusion on vaccination strategies using dengue and yellow fever as case studies.	Superinfection exclusion is a phenomenon whereby the co-infection of a host with a secondary pathogen is prevented due to a current infection by another closely-related pathogenic strain. We construct a novel vector-host mathematical model for two pathogens that exhibit superinfection exclusion and simultaneously account for vaccination strategies against them. We then derive the conditions under which an endemic disease will prevent the establishment of another through the action of superinfection exclusion and show that vaccination against the endemic strain can enable the previously suppressed strain to invade the population. Through appropriate parameterisation of the model for dengue and yellow fever we find that superinfection exclusion alone is unlikely to explain the absence of yellow fever in many regions where dengue is endemic, and that the rollout of the recently licensed dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, is unlikely to enable the establishment of Yellow Fever in regions where it has previously been absent. <br>	883	155	4
Bauhinia holophylla (Bong.) Steud. leaves-derived extracts as potent anti-dengue serotype 2.	Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral pathogen and made the disease a major health concern worldwide. However, specific antiviral drugs against this arbovirose or vaccines are not yet available for treatment or prevention. Thus, here we aimed to study the antiviral activity of hydroethanolic extract, fraction ethyl acetate and subfractions of the leaves of Bauhinia holophylla (Fabaceae:Cercideae), a native plant of the Brazilian Cerrado, against DENV-2 by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method in mammalian cells culture. As results, the hydroethanolic extract showed the most potent effect, with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.2 μg mL-1 and selectivity index (SI) of 27.6, approximately 16-times higher anti-DENV-2 activity than of the ribavirin (IC50 52.8 μg mL-1). Our results showed in this study appointed that B. holophylla has a promising anti-dengue activity, which was associated mainly with the presence of flavonoids. <br>	851	155	6
Development of peptide biosensor for the detection of dengue fever biomarker, nonstructural 1.	Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein is a specific and sensitive biomarker for the diagnosis of dengue. In this study, an efficient electrochemical biosensor that uses chemically modified affinity peptides was developed for the detection of dengue virus NS1. A series of amino acid-substituted synthetic peptides was rationally designed, chemically synthesized and covalently immobilized to a gold sensor surface. The sensor performance was monitored via square wave voltammetry (SWV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Potential affinity peptides specific for NS1 were chosen according to the dynamic current decrease in SWV experiments. Using circular dichroism, the molar ellipticity of peptides (DGV BP1-BP5) was determined, indicating that they had a mostly similar in random coil structure, not totally identical. Using SWV, DGV BP1 was selected as a promising recognition peptide and limit of detection for NS1 was found to be 1.49 μg/mL by the 3-sigma rule. DGV BP1 showed good specificity and stability for NS1, with low signal interference. The validation of the sensor to detect NS1 proteins was confirmed with four dengue virus culture broth (from serotype 1 to 4) as proof-of-concept. The detection performance of our sensor incorporating DGV BP1 peptides showed a statistically significant difference. These results indicate that this strategy can potentially be used to detect the dengue virus antigen, NS1, and to diagnosis dengue fever within a miniaturized portable device in point-of-care testing. <br>	1323	238	11
Reducing the cost and assessing the performance of a novel adult mass-rearing cage for the dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika vector, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus).	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe widespread emergence of resistance to insecticides used to control adult Aedes mosquitoes has made traditional control strategies inadequate for the reduction of various vector populations. Therefore, complementary vector control methods, such as the Sterile Insect Technique, are needed to enhance existing efforts. The technique relies on the rearing and release of large numbers of sterile males, and the development of efficient and standardized mass-rearing procedures and tools is essential for its application against medically important mosquitoes. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the effort to reduce the cost of the rearing process, a prototype low-cost plexiglass mass-rearing cage has been developed and tested for egg production and egg hatch rate in comparison to the current Food and Agriculture Organization/International Atomic Energy Agency (FAO/IAEA) stainless-steel cage. Additionally, an adult-index was validated and used as a proxy to estimate the mosquito survival rates by counting the number of male and female mosquitoes that were resting within each of the 6 squares at a given point of time each day in the cage. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe study has shown that the prototype mass-rearing cage is cheap and is as efficient as the FAO/IAEA stainless-steel cage in terms of egg production, with even better overall egg hatch rate. The mean numbers of eggs per cage, after seven cycles of blood feeding and egg collection, were 969,789 ± 138,101 and 779,970 ± 123,042, corresponding to 81 ± 11 and 65 ± 10 eggs per female over her lifespan, in the prototype and the stainless-steel-mass-rearing cages, respectively. The longevity of adult male and female mosquitoes was not affected by cage type and, the adult-index could be considered as an appropriate proxy for survival. Moreover, the mass-rearing cage prototype is easy to handle and transport and improves economic and logistic efficiency. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe low-cost mass-rearing prototype cage can be recommended to produce Ae. aegypti in the context of rear and release techniques. The proposed adult-index can be used as a quick proxy of mosquito survival rates in mass-rearing settings. <br>	1789	982	12

Community perception and risk reduction practices toward malaria and dengue: A mixed-method study in slums of Chetla, Kolkata.	<b>Background:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGlobally, vector-borne diseases account for 17% of infectious disease burden. In India, despite accelerated efforts, both malaria and dengue are major public health concern. Understanding local community perspectives is essential to strengthen ongoing program activities. <br><b>Objectives:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe study aimed to assess the community perceptions and risk reduction practices toward prevention and control of malaria and dengue at slums of Chetla in South Kolkata and to explore the perspectives of relevant local stakeholders in this regard. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis cross-sectional study with mixed-method design was conducted from June to September 2018. Quantitative data were collected in 288 sampled households through face-to-face interview of respondents and environmental checklist, whereas, qualitative exploration was done with five key informant interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 Software. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically using "cut and sort" processing technique. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn household survey, majority had unsatisfactory knowledge (68.4%), attitude (64.2%), and practices (62.8%) regarding diseases prevention/control, which was further substantiated by qualitative findings. The use of electric fans (79.5%), mosquito repellents (53.8%) were predominant practices; however, only a few used bed nets regularly (26.0%). Reportedly, "heat" and "poor ventilation" were key reasons behind reluctance to use bed nets. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that increasing age, proximity to a nearby canal, and unsatisfactory knowledge significantly predicted unfavorable attitude, whereas, respondents' gender and unfavorable attitude significantly predicted poor practices. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIntensified social behavior change communication with active community participation is the need of the hour to prevent malaria and dengue occurrence and future outbreaks. <br>	1614	862	12
Human T Cell Response to Dengue Virus Infection.	DENV is a major public health problem worldwide, thus underlining the overall significance of the proposed Program. The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (1-4) cause the most common mosquito-borne viral disease of humans, with 3 billion people at risk for infection and up to 100 million cases each year, most often affecting children. The protective role of T cells during viral infection is well-established. Generally, CD8 T cells can control viral infection through several mechanisms, including direct cytotoxicity, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α. Similarly, CD4 T cells are thought to control viral infection through multiple mechanisms, including enhancement of B and CD8 T cell responses, production of inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines, cytotoxicity, and promotion of memory responses. To probe the phenotype of virus-specific T cells, epitopes derived from viral sequences need to be known. Here we discuss the identification of CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes derived from DENV and how these epitopes have been used by researchers to interrogate the phenotype and function of DENV-specific T cell populations. <br>	991	185	7
Phylogeography and invasion history of Aedes aegypti, the Dengue and Zika mosquito vector in Cape Verde islands (West Africa).	Aedes-borne arboviruses have spread globally with outbreaks of vast impact on human populations and health systems. The West African archipelago of Cape Verde had its first outbreak of Dengue in 2009, at the time the largest recorded in Africa, and was one of the few African countries affected by the Zika virus epidemic. Aedes aegypti was the mosquito vector involved in both outbreaks. We performed a phylogeographic and population genetics study of A. aegypti in Cape Verde in order to infer the geographic origin and evolutionary history of this mosquito. These results are discussed with respect to the implications for vector control and prevention of future outbreaks. Mosquitoes captured before and after the Dengue outbreak on the islands of Santiago, Brava, and Fogo were analyzed with two mitochondrial genes COI and ND4, 14 microsatellite loci and five kdr mutations. Genetic variability was comparable to other African populations. Our results suggest that A. aegypti invaded Cape Verde at the beginning of the Holocene from West Africa. Given the historic importance of Cape Verde in the transatlantic trade of the 16th-17th centuries, a possible contribution to the genetic pool of the founding populations in the New World cannot be fully discarded. However, contemporary gene flow with the Americas is likely to be infrequent. No kdr mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance were detected. The implications for vector control and prevention of future outbreaks are discussed. <br>	1274	236	14
Dengue in hospitalized children with sickle cell disease: A retrospective cohort study in the French departments of America.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo describe the characteristics of dengue in sickle cell children and try to identify risk factors of severity. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this retrospective study, we describe the evolution according to genotype (SS or SC and controls) and severity. <br><b>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom 2005 to 2013, 106 hospitalizations for dengue fever were recorded, 35 SS genotype, 35 SC and 36 without SCD or any other chronic disease. The clinical evolution was quite different. During hospitalization, SC patients were more likely to develop multiorgan failure (31.4% versus 25.7% for SS, and 0% for controls, p=0.001), or acute pulmonary complications than patients without SC sickle cell disease (14.3% versus 8.6% for SS, and 0% for controls, p=0.03). Level 3 analgesic treatment was more frequent in SC patients (22.9% versus 3% for SS, and 0% for controls, p<0.001). Patients with SC sickle cell disease had a higher proportion of severe forms of dengue (57.1% versus 37.1% for SS, and 0% for controls, p<0.001) than patients without SC sickle cell disease. Transfer in intensive care unit was required for most SC patients (22.9% versus 3% for SS, and 0% for controls, p=0.005).Fatal episodes were more frequent in SC patients than in patients without SC sickle cell disease (5 deaths versus 1 for SS and 0 for controls, p=0.02). Thirty-three patients (47.1%) were diagnosed as having severe dengue (13 SS and 20 SC). On univariate analysis, age >10 years, acute pulmonary complications, multiorgan failure, severe anemia requiring transfusion, use of antibiotic treatment, need for treatment with morphine, and longer hospital stay were statistically more frequent in severe dengue-associated cases. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that HbSC genotype and acute pulmonary complications, were significantly associated with severe dengue. In the multivariate model, the area of the ROC curve was 0.831. Children with SC genotype, typically thought to have less severe disease, actually had a higher rate of severe dengue and death than those with SS genotype. <br>	1702	446	12
The clinical profile, hematological parameters and liver transaminases of dengue NS1 Ag positive patients admitted to Jaffna Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspObjective of the study is to evaluate the on-admission day symptoms and signs, clinical, hematological parameters and liver transaminases of the dengue NS1 positive patients who got admitted on different clinical phases [Febrile phase (day 1-3) and Critical phase(day 4-5)] of dengue at medical wards of Jaffna Teaching Hospital. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlood samples were collected from 150 suspected dengue patients from day 1 to 5 of the illness. Seventy-eight patients were positive for dengue NS1, according to the WHO proposed dengue clinical phase framework 37 patients were from febrile phase and 41 patients from critical phase. Patients who admitted on critical phase framework suffered from leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Nine patients had the evidence of leakage with fever and the leakers had significant rise in hemoglobin, hematocrit and liver transaminase levels which are considered as severe form of the disease. <br>	774	221	5
Commentary: Dengue hemorrhagic fever: Panophthalmitis or sterile sclerocorneal melt?		0	0	0
Panophthalmitis associated with scleral necrosis in dengue hemorrhagic fever.	Dengue is a mosquito-borne flavivirus disease affecting humans. The Aedes aegypti mosquito spreads it. Ophthalmic manifestations of dengue range from subconjunctival hemorrhage to optic neuropathy. Panophthalmitis in dengue fever is a rare finding. We report a case of a 22-year-old male having dengue fever, who presented with pain, redness, swelling and loss of vision in his right eye. He was diagnosed as panophthalmitis with subretinal hemorrhage and required right eye evisceration. <br>	423	76	6
Scaled deployment of Wolbachia to protect the community from dengue and other  Aedes transmitted arboviruses.	Background: A number of new technologies are under development for the control of mosquito transmitted viruses, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika that all require the release of modified mosquitoes into the environment. None of these technologies has been able to demonstrate evidence that they can be implemented at a scale beyond small pilots. Here we report the first successful citywide scaled deployment of Wolbachia in the northern Australian city of Townsville. Methods: The wMel strain of Wolbachia was backcrossed into a local Aedes aegypti genotype and mass reared mosquitoes were deployed as eggs using mosquito release containers (MRCs). In initial stages these releases were undertaken by program staff but in later stages this was replaced by direct community release including the development of a school program that saw children undertake releases. Mosquito monitoring was undertaken with Biogents Sentinel (BGS) traps and individual mosquitoes were screened for the presence of Wolbachia with a Taqman qPCR or LAMP diagnostic assay. Dengue case notifications from Queensland Health Communicable Disease Branch were used to track dengue cases in the city before and after release. Results: Wolbachia was successfully established into local Ae. aegypti mosquitoes across 66 km 2 in four stages over 28 months with full community support.  A feature of the program was the development of a scaled approach to community engagement. Wolbachia frequencies have remained stable since deployment and to date no local dengue transmission has been confirmed in any area of Townsville after Wolbachia has established, despite local transmission events every year for the prior 13 years and an epidemiological context of increasing imported cases. Conclusion: Deployment of Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti populations can be readily scaled to areas of ~60km 2 quickly and cost effectively and appears in this context to be effective at stopping local dengue transmission. <br>	1681	301	13
Detecting space-time clusters of dengue fever in Panama after adjusting for vector surveillance data.	Long term surveillance of vectors and arboviruses is an integral aspect of disease prevention and control systems in countries affected by increasing risk. Yet, little effort has been made to adjust space-time risk estimation by integrating disease case counts with vector surveillance data, which may result in inaccurate risk projection when several vector species are present, and when little is known about their likely role in local transmission. Here, we integrate 13 years of dengue case surveillance and associated Aedes occurrence data across 462 localities in 63 districts to estimate the risk of infection in the Republic of Panama. Our exploratory space-time modelling approach detected the presence of five clusters, which varied by duration, relative risk, and spatial extent after incorporating vector species as covariates. The Ae. aegypti model contained the highest number of districts with more dengue cases than would be expected given baseline population levels, followed by the model accounting for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. This implies that arbovirus case surveillance coupled with entomological surveillance can affect cluster detection and risk estimation, potentially improving efforts to understand outbreak dynamics at national scales. <br>	1095	190	9
Dengue illness impacts daily human mobility patterns in Iquitos, Peru.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHuman mobility plays a central role in shaping pathogen transmission by generating spatial and/or individual variability in potential pathogen-transmitting contacts. Recent research has shown that symptomatic infection can influence human mobility and pathogen transmission dynamics. Better understanding the complex relationship between symptom severity, infectiousness, and human mobility requires quantification of movement patterns throughout infectiousness. For dengue virus (DENV), human infectiousness peaks 0-2 days after symptom onset, making it paramount to understand human movement patterns from the beginning of illness. <br><b>METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThrough community-based febrile surveillance and RT-PCR assays, we identified a cohort of DENV+ residents of the city of Iquitos, Peru (n = 63). Using retrospective interviews, we measured the movements of these individuals when healthy and during each day of symptomatic illness. The most dramatic changes in mobility occurred during the first three days after symptom onset; individuals visited significantly fewer locations (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.017) and spent significantly more time at home (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.005), compared to when healthy. By 7-9 days after symptom onset, mobility measures had returned to healthy levels. Throughout an individual's symptomatic period, the day of illness and their subjective sense of well-being were the most significant predictors for the number of locations and houses they visited. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur study is one of the first to collect and analyze human mobility data at a daily scale during symptomatic infection. Accounting for the observed changes in human mobility throughout illness will improve understanding of the impact of disease on DENV transmission dynamics and the interpretation of public health-based surveillance data. <br>	1552	614	11
Modelling the Host Immune Response to Mature and Immature Dengue Viruses.	Immature dengue virions contained in patient blood samples are essentially not infectious because the uncleaved surface protein prM renders them incompetent for membrane fusion. However, the immature virions regain full infectivity when they interact with anti-prM antibodies, and once opsonised virion fusion into Fc receptor-expressing cells is facilitated. We propose a within-host mathematical model for the immune response which takes into account the dichotomy between mature infectious and immature noninfectious dengue virions. The model accounts for experimental observations on the different interactions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells with infected cells producing virions with different infectivity. We compute the basic reproduction number as a function of the proportion of infected cells producing noninfectious virions and use numerical simulations to compare the host's immune response in a primary and a secondary dengue infections. The results can be placed in the immunoregulatory framework with plasmacytoid dendritic cells serving as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune response, and pose questions for potential experimental work to validate hypothesis about the evolutionary context whereby the virus strives to maximise its chance for transmission from the human host to the mosquito vector. <br>	1149	192	6
Dengue virus infection in people residing in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence studies.	Better knowledge of the face of the current dengue virus (DENV) epidemiology in Africa can help to implement efficient strategies to curb the burden of dengue fever. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of DENV infection in Africa. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, African Journals Online, and Africa Index Medicus from January 1st, 2000 to June 10th, 2019 without any language restriction. We used a random-effects model to pool studies. A total of 76 studies (80,977 participants; 24 countries) were included. No study had high risk of bias. Twenty-two (29%) had moderate and 54 (71%) had low risk of bias. In apparently healthy individuals, the pooled prevalence of DENV was 15.6% (95% confidence interval 9.9-22.2), 3.5% (0.8-7.8), and 0.0% (0.0-0.5) respectively for immunoglobulins (Ig) G, IgM, and for ribonucleic acid (RNA) in apparently healthy populations. In populations presenting with fever, the prevalence was 24.8% (13.8-37.8), 10.8% (3.8-20.6k) and 8.4% (3.7-14.4) for IgG, IgM, and for RNA respectively. There was heterogeneity in the distribution between different regions of Africa. The prevalence of DENV infection is high in the African continent. Dengue fever therefore deserves more attention from healthcare workers, researchers, and health policy makers. <br>	1128	227	12
Time elapsed between Zika and dengue virus infections affects antibody and T cell responses.	Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are co-endemic in many parts of the world, but the impact of ZIKV infection on subsequent DENV infection is not well understood. Here we show in rhesus macaques that the time elapsed after ZIKV infection affects the immune response to DENV infection. We show that previous ZIKV exposure increases the magnitude of the antibody and T cell responses against DENV. The time interval between ZIKV and subsequent DENV infection further affects the immune response. A mid-convalescent period of 10 months after ZIKV infection results in higher and more durable antibody and T cell responses to DENV infection than a short period of 2 months. In contrast, previous ZIKV infection does not affect DENV viremia or pro-inflammatory status. Collectively, we find no evidence of a detrimental effect of ZIKV immunity in a subsequent DENV infection. This supports the implementation of ZIKV vaccines that could also boost immunity against future DENV epidemics. <br>	839	162	8
Extensive genomic recoding by codon-pair deoptimization selective for mammals is a flexible tool to generate attenuated vaccine candidates for dengue virus 2.	The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) are the leading etiologic agent of disease caused by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) in the world, with billions at risk of DENV infection spread by infected mosquitoes. DENV causes illness ranging from dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DENV proliferates well in two different host systems, an invertebrate mosquito vector and vertebrate primate host, which have a distinct difference in their preference of codon pairs (CP) for translation (different "codon pair bias"). Consequently, arboviruses must delicately balance the use of codon pairs between mammals and arthropods, which presents an Achilles' heel that we have exploited by specifically shifting the codon pair preference in the E and NS3 ORFs away from mammals while keeping the CPB favorable for mosquito ORFs. Here we report that recoding of the ORFs has led to variants that were over-attenuated in rhesus macaques although induction of protective antibodies in animals vaccinated with the smallest recoded ORF (E) was observed. The flexibility of our synthetic vaccine design (by decreasing the number of unfavorable CPs in the E ORF), allowed us to construct two new vaccine candidates (EhminA and EhminB) with intermediate attenuation in cell culture and neonatal mice, a result demonstrating proof of concept. New DENV vaccine candidates are being developed based on selective attenuation by dramatic recoding, with flexibility in balancing the attenuation and immunogenicity by marrying rational design and empirical modification. <br>	1383	245	7
Current prevention and potential treatment options for dengue infection.	Currently, treatments for dengue infection are only symptomatic as no antiviral agents nor vaccines are available to combat this virus. Despite challenges faced by researchers, many efforts are ongoing to reduce cases of dengue infection either by targeting the vector or the virus. Vector population is monitored and reduced by using mechanical, chemical and biological controls. Chemical control is achieved either by using synthetic or natural insecticides where the latter is more preferable. In biological control, bacteria, fungi and larvivorous fish are utilised to reduce the vector population. Moreover, genes of mosquitoes are also explored to produce progenies which are sterile with low survival ability. Vaccines are among the most effective ways to prevent viral infection. Various approaches have been used and are still being explored towards producing vaccines for dengue. These include live attenuated, inactivated, recombinant subunit, nucleic acid and virus-like particles vaccines. The aim is to produce a vaccine which can target all the four serotypes of the virus. Monoclonal antibodies are widely researched on to equip the host defense mechanism against the dengue virus. Deeper understanding of the virus replication cycle warrants the development of antiviral agents which target viral proteins vital for the replication process. Bioactive compounds are also utilised in the development of antiviral agents. The importance of surveillance and supportive therapy are also discussed. <br>	1295	223	14
Inhibitory Effect of Alpha-Mangostin to Dengue Virus Replication and Cytokines Expression in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.	Massive pro-inflammatory cytokines production has been correlated with the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease. The active compound of mangosteen fruit pericarps, α-mangostin, has been commonly used as traditional medicine and dietary supplement. We examined the effect of α-mangostin against dengue virus (DENV) infection in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by the measurement of virus titer and TNF-α and IFN-γ cytokines concentration post infection. Increasing concentration of α-mangostin inhibited virus replication and reduced inflammatory cytokines expression at 24- and 48-h post infection. Our results support the potential use of α-mangostin as anti-antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies in the treatment of dengue. <br>	652	112	5
Risk factors for dengue outbreaks in Odisha, India: A case-control study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEnvironmental and climatic risk factors of dengue outbreak has been studied in detail. However, the socio-epidemiological association with the disease is least explored. The study aims to identify the social and ecological factors associated with emerging dengue in Odisha, India. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA population-based case-control study (age and sex matched at the ratio of 1:1) was conducted in six districts of the state in 2017. A structured validated questionnaire was used to collect information for each consenting participant. An ecological household survey was done using a checklist during the month of July-September. Along with the descriptive statistics, conditional logistic regression model was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio using STATA. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOf 380 cases, nearly 55% were male and the median age was 33years. The adjusted odds of having dengue was nearly three times higher among the people having occupation which demands long travel, presence of breeding sites (1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.6), presence of swampy area near home (1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.1) and having travel history close to the index date (1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.4). People staying in thatched houses had three times higher risk of the disease, however, households keeping the swampy areas clean had 50% less risk for the disease (0.5; 95% CI 0.31-0.67). Nearly 22.2% of cases had a travel history during the index date. Of them, 36% had diagnosis before the travel, whereas, 64% developed the disease after the returning from the travel. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHousehold factors such as occupation and ecological condition of households play important roles in dengue outbreaks in Odisha. However, our study suggests travel/commuting are also essential factors to be considered during disease prevention planning. <br>	1479	788	13
Molecular basis of dengue virus serotype 2 morphological switch from 29°C to 37°C.	The ability of DENV2 to display different morphologies (hence different antigenic properties) complicates vaccine and therapeutics development. Previous studies showed most strains of laboratory adapted DENV2 particles changed from smooth to "bumpy" surfaced morphology when the temperature is switched from 29°C at 37°C. Here we identified five envelope (E) protein residues different between two alternative passage history DENV2 NGC strains exhibiting smooth or bumpy surface morphologies. Several mutations performed on the smooth DENV2 infectious clone destabilized the surface, as observed by cryoEM. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated how chemically subtle substitution at various positions destabilized dimeric interactions between E proteins. In contrast, three out of four DENV2 clinical isolates showed a smooth surface morphology at 37°C, and only at high fever temperature (40°C) did they become "bumpy". These results imply vaccines should contain particles representing both morphologies. For prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, this study also informs on which types of antibodies should be used at different stages of an infection, i.e., those that bind to monomeric E proteins on the bumpy surface or across multiple E proteins on the smooth surfaced virus. <br>	1114	188	8
Antibody-Dependent Dengue Virus Entry Modulates Cell Intrinsic Responses for Enhanced Infection.	Dengue is caused by infection with any one of four dengue viruses (DENV); the risk of severe disease appears to be enhanced by the cross-reactive or subneutralizing levels of antibody from a prior DENV infection. These antibodies opsonize DENV entry through the activating Fc gamma receptors (FcγR), instead of infection through canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis, to result in higher levels of DENV replication. However, whether the enhanced replication is solely due to more efficient FcγR-mediated DENV entry or is also through FcγR-mediated alteration of the host transcriptome response to favor DENV infection remains unclear. Indeed, more efficient viral entry through activation of the FcγR can result in an increased viral antigenic load within target cells and confound direct comparisons of the host transcriptome response under antibody-dependent and antibody-independent conditions. Herein, we show that, despite controlling for the viral antigenic load in primary monocytes, the antibody-dependent and non-antibody-dependent routes of DENV entry induce transcriptome responses that are remarkably different. Notably, antibody-dependent DENV entry upregulated DENV host dependency factors associated with RNA splicing, mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, and vesicle trafficking. Additionally, supporting findings from other studies, antibody-dependent DENV entry impeded the downregulation of ribosomal genes caused by canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis to increase viral translation. Collectively, our findings support the notion that antibody-dependent DENV entry alters host responses that support the viral life cycle and that host responses to DENV need to be defined in the context of its entry pathway.IMPORTANCE Dengue virus is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral infection globally, resulting in variable manifestations ranging from asymptomatic viremia to life-threatening shock and multiorgan failure. Previous studies have indicated that the risk of severe dengue in humans can be increased by a specific range of preexisting anti-dengue virus antibody titers, a phenomenon termed antibody-dependent enhancement. There is hence a need to understand how antibodies augment dengue virus infection compared to the alternative canonical receptor-mediated viral entry route. Herein, we show that, besides facilitating viral uptake, antibody-mediated entry increases the expression of early host dependency factors to promote viral infection; these factors include RNA splicing, mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, vesicle trafficking, and ribosomal genes. These findings will enhance our understanding of how differences in entry pathways can affect host responses and offer opportunities to design therapeutics that can specifically inhibit antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection. <br>	2472	404	12
Anti-viral activity of culinary and medicinal mushroom extracts against dengue virus serotype 2: an in-vitro study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that has become a major public health concern worldwide. Presently, there is no specific vaccine or treatment available for dengue viral infection. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLignosus rhinocerotis, Pleurotus giganteus, Hericium erinaceus, Schizophyllum commune and Ganoderma lucidium were selected for evaluation of their in-vitro anti-dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) activities. Hot aqueous extracts (HAEs), ethanol extracts (EEs), hexane soluble extracts (HSEs), ethyl acetate soluble extracts (ESEs) and aqueous soluble extracts (ASEs) were prepared from the selected mushrooms. The cytotoxic effects of the extracts were evaluated by the MTT assay. The anti-DENV-2 activities of the extracts were evaluated in three different assays: simultaneous, attachment and penetration assays were perfomed using plaque reduction assays and RT-qPCR assays. The effect of the addition time on viral replication was assessed by the time of addition assay, and a virucidal assay was carried out to evaluate the direct effect of each mushroom extract on DENV-2. The chemical composition of glucans, and the protein and phenolic acid contents in the extracts were estimated. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe found that the HAEs and ASEs of L. rhinocerotis, P. giganteus, H. erinaceus and S. commune were the least toxic to Vero cells and showed very prominent anti-DENV2 activity. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of the ASEs ranged between 399.2-637.9 μg/ml, while for the HAEs the range was 312.9-680.6 μg/ml during simultaneous treatment. Significant anti-dengue activity was also detected in the penetration assay of ASEs (IC50: 226.3-315.4 μg/ml) and HAEs (IC50: 943.1-2080.2 μg/ml). Similarly, we observed a marked reduction in the expression levels of the ENV and NS5 genes in the simultaneous and penetration assays of the ASEs and HAEs. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the highest percent of anti-DENV2 activity was observed when the mushroom extracts were added immediately after virus adsorption. None of the extracts exhibited virucidal effect. Chemical composition analysis showed that the major components in the mushroom HAEs and ASEs were glucan (beta D-glucan) and proteins, however, there was no significant correlation between the anti-dengue activity and the concentration of glucans and proteins. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese findings demonstrated the potential of mushroom extracts as anti-dengue therapeutic agents with less toxic effects. <br>	2089	1043	20
Increase of Plasma TNF-α Is Associated with Decreased Levels of Blood Platelets in Clinical Dengue Infection.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection has become an increasingly common concern in tropical and subtropical regions. It has protean manifestations ranging from febrile phase to severe life-threatening illness. In this study, we estimated Th1 and Th2 cytokines and correlated the levels with dengue severity along with certain hematological and biochemical parameters. We also studied the seroprevalence of dengue between October and December 2017 at the Government Theni Medical College, India. Individuals with dengue fever (DF) were positive for either IgM or IgG, or both. The biochemical and hematological parameters along with plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-13, IL-12p70, IL-10, IL-5, IL-4, and IL-2 cytokines were estimated. The prevalence of DF was 42.9% during the study period. IL-2, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-10 levels were significantly elevated (p < 0.005) in patients with secondary DENV infection, whereas the level of IL-13 remained unaltered during both primary and secondary infections. No statistically significant difference was noticed with IL-12p70, IL-5, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF between the healthy controls and the primary and secondary DENV-infected groups. Increase of 1 unit of TNF-α was associated with a decrease of 160 units of blood platelets. Together, the study suggests that TNF-α could play a key role in the pathogenesis of dengue, and despite the decrease in platelet levels, it remains to be seen whether any other inflammatory cells regulate the levels of TNF-α in DENV infection. <br>	1381	264	11
Oxidative stress response in the pathogenesis of dengue virus virulence, disease prognosis and therapeutics: an update.	Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that causes febrile illness and can lead to a potentially lethal disease. The mechanism of disease pathogenesis is not completely understood, and there are currently no vaccines or therapeutic drugs available to protect against all four serotypes of DENV. Although many reasons have been suggested for the development of the disease, dengue studies have shown that, during DENV infection, there is an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants that disrupts homeostasis. An increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels triggers the sudden release of cytokines, which can lead to plasma leakage and other severe symptoms. In the present review, we give an overview of the oxidative stress response and its effect on the progression of dengue disease. We also discuss the role of oxidative-stress-associated molecules in disease prognostic and therapeutics. <br>	780	141	6
Validation of educational booklet: an educational technology in dengue prevention.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto validate a booklet on dengue prevention in order to make it an educational technology to be used with the population. <br><b>METHOD:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmethodological study, carried out with two groups of judges specialized in health and other areas. For data analysis, the calculation of Content Validity Index was carried out. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe booklet, in general, was considered valid by the expert judges, since it obtained an overall CVI of 70%. However, it has undergone a textual and aesthetic re-elaboration. The changes were based on the substitution of expressions, phrases, information additions and language adequacy. The illustrations were redone, adding clarity, expressiveness, movement, interaction and contextualization. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe booklet is valid to be used for the population, with the purpose of informing, in a playful way, the forms of prevention and combat to mosquito transmitting dengue. <br>	736	388	8
[Seasonality of dengue reporting in state capitals in the Brazilian Amazon and impacts of El Niño/La Niña].	The dynamics of dengue transmission are multifactorial and involve socioeconomic, ecological, and environmental aspects, the latter being closely related to local climatic conditions that affect the vector's reproductive cycle. Climate depends in turn on tropical oceanic mechanisms such as phases of El Niño/La Niña over the Pacific. The study contributes to this discussion and reports on the correlations between the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) in the Pacific and the number of reported dengue cases in seven state capitals in the Brazilian Amazon from 2001 to 2012. The study also analyzes the seasonality pattern (quarterly mean values) in dengue cases throughout the region. Evidence that El Niño/La Niña causes a decrease versus increase in the local rainfall pattern is consistent with the lower versus higher number of reported dengue cases in most of the state capitals in the Amazon, a result proven by the statistically significant negative correlations seen in Manaus (Amazonas), São Luís (Maranhão), Belém (Pará) and Palmas (Tocantins). The 12-years means (2001-2012) revealed the presence of pronounced seasonality in dengue incidence in the majority of the state capitals, with sharp peaks from January to March [Rio Branco (Acre), Manaus, Belém and Palmas] and from April to June (São Luís), corresponding to 50-70% of the annual total. State capitals farther north [Boa Vista (Roraima) and Macapá (Amapá)] showed dengue reporting in all quarters of the year, with no pronounced seasonality. <br>	1286	238	6
A Rare Presentation of Coinfection: Dengue Virus and Hepatitis A Virus.	Dengue fever caused by dengue virus is a common tropical infection transmitted by the mosquitos Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Four strains of the genus flavivirus is responsible for the epidemics of varying severity. Hepatitis A caused by hepatitis A virus is spread by faecal-oral route. The culprit virus is a hepatovirus. Coinfection with dengue virus and hepatitis A virus is rare and is a diagnostic as well as management challenge to the medical professional. We report a patient who presented to us with dengue virus and hepatitis A virus coinfection. <br>	479	94	6
Detection of dengue using PAMAM dendrimer integrated tapered optical fiber sensor.	The exponential escalation of dengue cases has indeed become a global health crisis. This work elaborates on the development of a biofunctionalized tapered optical fiber (TOF) based sensor with the integration of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer for the detection of dengue E protein. The dimension of the TOF generated an evanescent field that was sensitive to any changes in the external medium while the integration of PAMAM promoted more adhesion of bio-recognition molecules; anti-DENV II E protein antibodies; that were complementary to the targeted protein. This in return created more active sites for the absorption of DENV II E proteins onto the tapered region. The resolution and detection limit of the sensor are 19.53 nm/nM and 1 pM, respectively with Kd = 1.02 × 10-10 M. <br>	666	131	5
Selective Detection of Dengue Virus Serotypes Using Tandem Toehold-Mediated Displacement Reactions.	Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common human arboviral infection worldwide and can present with severe clinical manifestations. Timely DENV detection improves clinical outcomes, and identification of the DENV serotype (DENV-1-4) may provide beneficial epidemiologic data to inform the initiation of control measures. Here, DENV RNA-triggered, enzyme-free tandem toehold-mediated displacement reactions were developed to identify and serotype DENV in RNA controls and contrived samples through the amplification of a fluorescent signal detected by the use of a fluorescent scanner and a confocal microscope. Each DENV serotype was detected selectively using both imaging methods. In addition, a 384-well plate was used to prepare an array for diagnosis of the four DENV RNA serotypes from contrived clinical samples. The four serotypes of dengue virus were detected using novel enzyme-free amplification reactions, which are more facile than amplification using reverse transcriptase PCR. <br>	854	148	6
Post-infectious functional gastrointestinal disorders in children after a non-severe dengue episode without warning signs	Introduction: The pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders involves infectious agents such as viruses. Objective: To study the development of functional gastrointestinal disorders 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after an episode of non-severe dengue without warning signs in children. Materials and methods: We conducted a cohort study in 73 children diagnosed with non-severe dengue without warning signs at Hospital Universitario del Valle “Evaristo García” and 62 healthy children from Cali, Colombia. Using the Questionnaire for Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rome III (QPGS-III) in Spanish we identified functional gastrointestinal disorders 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after non-severe dengue without warning signs. Measurements of central tendency, relative risk, chi square, and Fisher’s exact test were performed, with p<0.05 being significant. Results: We included 135 children who were 10.7±1.9 years old; 51.1% of them were male and 19.3% had a functional gastrointestinal disorder (9.6% of them had abdominal pain related to functional gastrointestinal disorders). There was a greater risk to present a functional gastrointestinal disorder and related abdominal pain in children after non-severe dengue without warning signs at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of follow-up, but without significant differences. Conclusion: Our study suggests that non-severe dengue without warning signs does not increase the risk of functional gastrointestinal disorders and related abdominal pain for up to 12 months of follow-up. <br>	1311	236	8

Host serum iron modulates dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes.	A blood meal is the primary route through which mosquitoes acquire an arbovirus infection. Blood components or their metabolites may regulate the susceptibility of mosquitoes to arboviruses. Here we report that serum iron in human blood influences dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes. Dengue virus acquisition by Aedes aegypti was inversely correlated with the iron concentration in serum from human donors. In a mouse-mosquito acquisition model, iron supplementation reduced dengue virus prevalence and viral load, whereas neutralization of serum iron facilitated dengue virus infection in A. aegypti mosquitoes. Of note, mosquitoes feeding on iron-deficient (sideropenic) mice exhibited a higher prevalence of dengue virus. Reversal of the sideropenic status of hosts largely reduced dengue virus acquisition and infection by mosquitoes. Serum iron, rather than haem-bound iron, was utilized by the mosquito iron metabolism pathway to boost the activity of reactive oxygen species in the gut epithelium, subsequently inhibiting infection by dengue virus. On the basis of these results, a status of iron deficiency in the human population might contribute to the vectorial permissiveness to dengue virus, thereby facilitating its spread by mosquitoes. <br>	1081	185	10
High levels of serum hyaluronan is an early predictor of dengue warning signs and perturbs vascular integrity.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA main pathological feature of severe dengue virus infection is endothelial hyper-permeability. The dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been implicated in the vascular leakage that characterizes severe dengue virus infection, however, the molecular mechanisms involved are not known. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cohort of 250 dengue patients has been followed from the onset of symptoms to the recovery phase. Serum hyaluronan levels and several other clinical parameters were recorded. The effect of NS1 treatment of cultured fibroblasts and endothelial cells on the expressions of hyaluronan synthetic and catabolic enzymes and the hyaluronan receptor CD44, were determined, as have the effects on the formation of hyaluronan-rich matrices and endothelial permeability. <br><b>FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspElevated serum hyaluronan levels (≥70 ng/ml) during early infection was found to be an independent predictor for occurrence of warning signs, and thus severe dengue fever. High circulating levels of the viral protein NS1, indicative of disease severity, correlated with high concentrations of serum hyaluronan. NS1 exposure decreased the expression of CD44 in differentiating endothelial cells impairing the integrity of vessel-like structures, and promoted the synthesis of hyaluronan in dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells in synergy with dengue-induced pro-inflammatory mediators. Deposited hyaluronan-rich matrices around cells cultured in vitro recruited CD44-expressing macrophage-like cells, suggesting a mechanism for enhancement of inflammation. In cultured endothelial cells, perturbed hyaluronan-CD44 interactions enhanced endothelial permeability through modulation of VE-cadherin and cytoskeleton re-organization, and exacerbated the NS1-induced disruption of endothelial integrity. <br><b>INTERPRETATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPharmacological targeting of hyaluronan biosynthesis and/or its CD44-mediated signaling may limit the life-threatening vascular leakiness during moderate-to-severe dengue virus infection.

Increased serum sialic acid is associated with morbidity and mortality in a murine model of dengue disease.	Dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent arboviral infection of humans, resulting in a spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infection to dengue fever to severe dengue characterized by vascular leakage and shock. Previously, we determined that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) induces endothelial hyperpermeability, disrupts the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) in vitro and triggers shedding of structural components, including sialic acid (Sia) and heparan sulfate. Here, using a murine model of dengue disease disease, we found high levels of Sia and NS1 circulating in mice with DENV-induced morbidity and lethal DENV infection. Further, we developed a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based method for quantifying free Sia in serum and determined that the levels of free N-glycolylneuraminic acid were significantly higher in DENV-infected mice than in uninfected controls. These data provide additional evidence that DENV infection disrupts EGL components in vivo and warrant further research assessing Sia as a biomarker of severe dengue disease. <br>	933	159	5

Fast emerging insecticide resistance in Aedes albopictus in Guangzhou, China: Alarm to the dengue epidemic.	Dengue is one of the most serious mosquito-borne infectious diseases in the world. Aedes albopictus is the most invasive mosquito and one of the primary vectors of dengue. Vector control using insecticides is the only viable strategy to prevent dengue virus transmission. In Guangzhou, after the 2014 pandemic, massive insecticides have been implemented. Massive insecticide use may lead to the development of resistance, but few reports are available on the status of insecticide resistance in Guangzhou after 2014. In this study, Ae. albopictus were collected from four districts with varied dengue virus transmission intensity in Guangzhou from 2015 to 2017. Adult Ae. albopictus insecticide susceptibility to deltamethrin (0.03%), permethrin(0.25%), DDT(4%), malathion (0.8%) and bendiocarb (0.1%) was determined by the standard WHO tube test, and larval resistance bioassays were conducted using temephos, Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), pyriproxyfen (PPF) and hexaflumuron. Mutations at the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene were analyzed. The effect of cytochrome P450s on the resistance of Ae. albopictus to deltamethrin was tested using the synergistic agent piperonyl butoxide (PBO). The results showed that Ae. albopictus populations have rapidly developed very high resistances to multiple commonly used insecticides at all study areas except malathion, Bti and hexaflumuron. We found 1534 codon mutations in the VGSC gene that were significantly correlated with the resistance to pyrethroids and DDT, and 11 synonymous mutations were also found in the gene. The resistance to deltamethrin can be significantly reduced by PBO but may generated cross-resistance to PPF. Fast emerging resistance in Ae. albopictus may affect mosquito management and threaten the prevention and control of dengue, similar to the resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes has prevented the elimination of malaria and call for timely and guided insecticide management. <br>	1724	298	16
Prevalence and laboratory analysis of malaria and dengue co-infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA clear understanding of the epidemiology of malaria and dengue co-infection is essential for informed decisions on appropriate control strategies for dengue and malaria. This systematic review synthesized evidence on the relationship of malaria and dengue co-infection and related it to alterations in platelet, hemoglobin, hematocrit, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels when compared to malaria mono-infection. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines was conducted. All published articles available in PubMed and Web of Science (ISI) databases before October 21, 2017 were recruited. All epidemiological studies except case reports on the prevalence or incidence of malaria and dengue co-infection among patients visiting hospitals with febrile illness were included. Studies that involved conference abstracts, protocols, systematic reviews, only mono-dengue or mono-malaria infections, and only animal or in vitro studies were excluded after screening the titles, abstracts, and body texts. Studies were additionally excluded after full text review when they lacked epidemiologic data on malaria and dengue co-infection. Two reviewers independently screened, reviewed, and assessed all the studies. Cochrane Q (Chi-square) and Moran's I2 were used to assess heterogeneity, and the funnel plot was used to examine publication bias. The summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a fixed-effects model. Thirteen cross-sectional and two retrospective studies were eligible to be included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOut of the 2269 citations screened, 15 articles were eligible to be included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The 15 studies involved 13,798 (10,373 cases with malaria and 3425 with dengue) patients in 9 countries. Thirteen studies compared the incidence and odds of Plasmodium sp. infection, five studies compared the odds of mean platelet, three studies compared Plasmodium parasite density, and four studies compared the odds of hemoglobin, hematocrit, AST, and ALT levels among co-infected groups and single-malaria-infected groups. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study showed that dengue and malaria co-infection was associated with decreased odds of malaria infection, malaria parasitemia, AST, and ALT levels when compared to malaria mono-infection. However, malaria and dengue co-infection was associated with increased odds of platelet and hemoglobin levels when compared to malaria mono-infection. <br>	2173	1077	17
A clinical and epidemiological survey of the largest dengue outbreak in Southern Taiwan in 2015.	<b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study examined the epidemiological, clinical and immunological characteristics of the 2015 dengue outbreak in Taiwan. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClinical data were collected from dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients. Phylogenetic tree was used to analyze the outbreak strain source. Paired plasma from DF/DHF patients were used for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay and cytokine multiplex biometric immunoassay to validate the immunological mechanism. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis outbreak mainly occurred in two of the southern cities of Taiwan; Tainan(22,777; 52%) and Kaohsiung (19,784; 45%). High DHF death rate (34.6%) was noticed. Case (DHF) and control (DF) study indicated that older age (>60yrs), type II diabetes and hypertension are risk factors correlated with DHF development (p < 0.0001). Phylogenetic tree results suggest that the outbreak-associated strain was dengue serotype 2 and cosmopolitan genotype, forming a stable cluster with the isolates from Thailand and Indonesia (bootstrap value of 99%). Cytokine analyses demonstrated that levels of IL-6, IL-4, IL-13, IL-1β, INF-γ and GM-CSF are significantly higher in DHF compared to DF patients (p < 0.001). ADE assay shows that diluted plasma containing preexisting dengue antibodies from DHF patients significantly enhanced dengue infection (p < 0.05). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe results suggests that older age, type II diabetes, hypertension, immunological cytokine dysregulation, as well as preexisting dengue antibodies inducing ADE infection are correlated with dengue severity. This study also indicates that the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan might have been a result of imported DF from dengue epidemic regions. <br>	1425	616	12
Glycyrrhizic acid derivatives as Dengue virus inhibitors.	Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most geographically distributed pathogenic flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitoes Aedes sps. In this study, the structure-antiviral activity relationships of Glycyrrhizic acid (GL) derivatives was evaluated by the inhibitory assays on the cytopathic effect (CPE) and viral infectivity of DENV type 2 (DENV2) in Vero E6 cells. GL (96% purity) had a low cytotoxicity to Vero E6 cells, inhibited DENV2-induced CPE, and reduced the DENV-2 infectivity with the IC50 of 8.1 μM. Conjugation of GL with amino acids or their methyl esters and the introduction of aromatic acylhydrazide residues into the carbohydrate part strongly influenced on the antiviral activity. Among compounds tested GL conjugates with isoleucine 13 and 11-aminoundecanoic acid 17 were found as potent anti-DENV2 inhibitors (IC50 1.2-1.3 μM). Therefore, modification of GL is a perspective way in the search of new antivirals against DENV2 infection. <br>	814	153	6
Toxic effect of essential oil and its compounds isolated from Sphaeranthus amaranthoides Burm. f. against dengue mosquito vector Aedes aegypti Linn.	Aedes aegypti is a major mosquito vector that can transfer many deadly diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever viruses. Due to the developing resistance among the vector populations by the application of chemical insecticides, alternative eco-friendly vector management strategies are being focused. In this aspect, the present study was carried out to evaluate the mosquitocidal potentials of essential oil of Sphaeranthus amaranthoides (EO-Sa). EO-Sa was found to be effective against Ae. aegypti mosquito vector by exhibiting significant larvicidal, adulticidal and repellent activities. GCMS analysis of EO-Sa revealed the presence of Carvone as the major component (peak area of 89.7%). The larvicidal bioassays performed revealed that the second instar larvae were relatively more susceptible (94.32% mortality) to EO-Sa treatments (75 ppm), LC50, 20.38 ppm.The sub lethal treatment concentration (20 ppm) significantly affected the oviposition, fecundity and morphology of Ae. aegypti. At sub lethal treatment concentration, EO-Sa down regulated α- and β carboxylesterase and up regulated the GST and CYP450 level of third and fourth instar larvae. Thus the present results illustrates that EO-Sa can deliver a durable larvicidal, repellent and adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti in an effective and eco-friendly manner. <br>	1167	207	11

Chemical composition of the essential oil and n-hexane extract of Stachys tmolea subsp. Tmolea Boiss., an endemic species of Turkey, and their mosquitocidal activity against dengue vector Aesdes aegypti.	Stachys tmolea subsp. tmolea Boiss. is endemic to Turkey and is a species of the genus Stachys L. which is one of the largest genera of the family Lamiaceae with about 300 species. The aims of this study were to examine the chemical composition of the essential oil and n-hexane extract of S. tmolea subsp. tmolea as natural sources of insecticidal activity against the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. Analysis of the essential oil by GC-FID and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) systems identified hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (15%), viridiflorol (10%), hexadecanoic acid (7%) and 9-geranyl-p-cymene (6%) as major components. The volatile components of the n-hexane extract were extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and were analyzed using GC-MS. The principal constituents were 3,4-dimethyl decane (16%), 3-methyl-3-pentanol (15%), 2-methyl-2-pentanol (12%), 1,4-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl) benzene (12%), heptanal (10%), acetic acid (6%) and decane (4%). Bioassay of the n-hexane extract, at 5 µg/mosquito, produced 90% mortality against adult Ae. aegypti while the S. tmolea essential oil demonstrated 13% mortality. No larvicidal activity was observed both in essential oil and n-hexane extract. Further studies are needed to assess the adulticidal activity of the responsible compounds in the crude extract. <br>	1157	219	15
Updated recommendations of the International Dengue Initiative expert group for CYD-TDV vaccine implementation in Latin America.	Dengue disease represents a large and growing global threat to public health, causing a significant burden to health systems of endemic countries. For countries considering vaccination as part of their Integrated Management Strategy for Prevention and Control of Dengue, the World Health Organization currently recommends the first licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV for: individuals aged 9 years or above from populations with high transmission rates, based on either seroprevalence criteria or pre-vaccination screening strategies, and for persons with confirmed prior exposure to infection in moderate to lower transmission settings. This paper describes the main conclusions of the Sixth Meeting of the International Dengue Initiative (IDI) held in June 2018, following release of a new product label by the manufacturer, updated WHO-SAGE recommendations, additional scientific evidence on vaccine performance, and reports of experiences by implementing countries. Considerations were made regarding the need for improving the quality of epidemiological and surveillance data in the region to help define the convenience of either of the two vaccination strategies recommended by WHO-SAGE. Extensive discussion was dedicated to the pros and cons of implementing either of such strategies in Latin America. Although, in general, a seroprevalence-based approach was preferred in high transmission settings, when cost-effectivity is favorable pre-vaccination screening is a convenient alternative. Cost-effectiveness evaluations can assist with the decisions by public health authorities of whether to introduce a vaccine. Where implemented, vaccine introduction should be part of a public health strategy that includes the participation of multiple sectors of society, incorporating input from scientific societies, ministries of heath, and civil society, while ensuring a robust communication program. <br>	1646	272	8
Evaluating the suitability of RNA intervention mechanism exerted by some flavonoid molecules against dengue virus MTase RNA capping site: a molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy study.	Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne human pathogens known to the mankind. Currently, no vaccines or standard therapy is avaliable to treate DENV infection. This makes the drug development against DENV more significant and challenging. The MTase domain of DENV RNA RdRp NS5 is a promising drug target, because this domain hosts the RNA capping process of DENV RNA to escape from human immune system. In the present study, we have analysed the RNA intervention mechanism exerted by flavoniod molecules against NS5 MTase RNA capping site by using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and the binding free energy calculations. The results from the docking analysis confirmed that the RNA intervention mecanism is exerted by the quercetagetin (QGN) molecule with all necessary intermolecular interactions and high binding affinity. Notably, QGN forms strong hydrogen bonding interactions with Asn18, Leu20 and Ser150 residues and π⋅⋅⋅π stacking interaction with Phe25 residue. The apo and QGN bound NS5 MTase and QGN-NS5 MTase complex were used for MD simulation. The results of MD simulation reveal that the RMSD and RMSF values of QGN-MTase complex have increased on comparing the apo protein due to the effect of ligand binding. The binding free energy calulation includes prediction of total binding free energy of ligand-protein complex and per-residue free energy decomposition. The QGN binding to NS5 MTase affects it's native motion, this result is found from Principal component analysis. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma. <br>	1335	248	13

Human parvovirus B19 genotype 1 in suspected dengue patients of Tefé, Amazonas State, Brazil.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHuman parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a common pathogen, which on infection causes variety of clinical conditions from benign self-limiting exanthematous disease and other similar pathologies to fetal death. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe collected 341 serum samples between the first and fourth day after the onset of symptoms from all patients suspected of dengue fever who were attended at Regional Hospital of Tefé. Initially, patients were screened for malaria by blood smear test and negative samples were sent to Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) situated in Manaus (AM) for dengue testing using semi-nested multiplex PCR. Further, we investigated 44 malaria and dengue-negative samples of children for B19V DNA by nested-PCR. Positive samples were analyzed by BLAST against entire public non-redundant nucleotide database and genotyped by phylogenetic analyses using neighbor-joining clustering method. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEight samples (18.2%) were found to be PCR positive. Fever, headache, ocular pain, and/or muscle pain were reported as the most frequent symptoms by the patients and none were diagnosed with rash at the time of sample collection. Phylogenetic analysis of major capsid protein 2 (VP2) and VP3 coding region showed high similarity with B19V genotype 1. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur results reveal the spread of B19V genotype 1 in Tefé. Moreover, our results emphasize the significance of laboratorial differential diagnosis using molecular techniques in patients with acute febrile, and thereby aid the health surveillance system in improving patient care even in the remote areas of Amazon. <br>	1345	692	10
Prevalence of self-reported dengue infections in Manaus Metropolitan Region: a cross-sectional study.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is an endemic and epidemic disease in Brazil, with a high burden of disease. Amazonas State has a high risk of transmission. This study aimed to assess the self-reported prevalence of dengue in adults living in Manaus Metropolitan Region. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cross-sectional study was conducted with adults living in Manaus Metropolitan Region in 2015. We performed a three-phase probabilistic sampling to collect participants' clinical and sociodemographic data. Self-reported dengue infection in the previous year was the primary outcome. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression analysis with robust variance were used to calculate the prevalence ratio (PR) of dengue infections with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Multilevel analysis including city and neighborhood variables was calculated. All analyses considered the complex sampling. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAmong the 4,001 participants, dengue in the previous year was self-reported by 7.0% (95% CI 6.3%-7.8%). Dengue was more frequent in women(PR 1.51; 95% CI 1.06-2.13), elderly participants (≥60 years old, PR 2.54; 95% CI 1.19-5.45), White and Asian participants (PR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.11-2.23), and individuals who had not received endemic agent visits (PR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.31-3.99). After multilevel analysis, sex was no longer a significant variable, with the remaining associations still significant. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeven out of 100 inhabitants of Manaus Metropolitan Region reported dengue in the previous year. Dengue was predominantly observed in women, elderly individuals, White and Asian individuals, and individuals who did not receive endemic agent visits. The setting plays an important role in dengue infections. <br>	1413	735	14

Can Complementary Prime-Boost Immunization Strategies Be an Alternative and Promising Vaccine Approach Against Dengue Virus?	Dengue is one of the most important diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. Dengvaxia®, a vaccine registered in several countries, cannot be administered to non-immune individuals and children younger than 9 years old, due to safety reasons. There are two vaccine candidates in phase 3 efficacy trials, but their registration date is completely unknown at this moment. So, the development of new vaccines or vaccine strategies continues to be a priority for the WHO. This work reviews some complementary prime-boost immunization studies against important human pathogens. Additionally, it reviews the results obtained using this regimen of immunization against dengue virus as a potential alternative approach for finding a safe and efficient vaccine. Finally, the main elements associated with this strategy are also discussed. The generation of new strategies of vaccination against dengue virus, must be directed to reduce the risk of increasing viral load through sub-neutralizing antibodies and it must be also directed to induce a polyfunctional T cell response. Complementary prime-boost immunization strategies could emerge as an interesting approach to induce solid immunity or at least to reduce viral load after natural infection, avoiding severe dengue. Subunit vaccine could be safe and attractive antigens for this strategy, especially proteins including B, and T-cells epitopes for inducing humoral and cellular immune responses, which can play an important role controlling the disease. <br>	1285	226	10
Secondary dengue infection in immunocompetent murine model leads to heart tissue damage.	Dengue, considered the most important arthropod-borne viral disease affecting humans, is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and caused by one of the four distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4). Infection with one of the four serotypes provides lifelong homotypic immunity. However, immunity against the heterologous serotypes is transient. As a consequence, secondary infection may lead to severer manifestations due to cross-reactivity of antibodies and T-cells. Over 500,000 people are hospitalized every year and around 2,5 million, living in endemic areas, are at risk of infection. Given the background, the development of vaccines and anti-DENV drugs is of the utmost importance, as is the characterization of an animal model for testing them. The purpose of this study was to investigate ultrastructural alterations caused by DENV secondary infection in BALB/c mice heart. To achieve our goal, six BALB/c mice were infected with DENV-1 and, 4 months later, reinfected with DENV-2. Uninfected mice were used as negative controls. Heart samples were collected and processed for ultrastructural and histopathological analysis. Our results showed edema, endothelium activation characterized by the presence of transport vesicles, free platelets in interstitium, mitochondria presenting rarefied matrix and degenerated cristae, and disorganization of muscle fibers. These results point not only to BALB/c mice susceptibility to DENV infection, but also to the fact that, although it is not an often reported occurrence, dengue can lead to heart damage. Keywords: dengue; experimental model; reinfection; BALB/c mice. <br>	1423	258	13
Synthetic peptide optimization improves the inhibition of dengue NS2B-NS3 protease and dengue replication in vitro.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the most widely-spread flavivirus infections with no effective antiviral drugs available. Peptide inhibitors have been considered as one of the best drug candidates due to their high specificity, selectivity in their interactions and minimum side effects. In this study, we employed computational studies using YASARA, HADDOCK server and PyMOL software to generate short and linear peptides based on a reference peptide, CP5-46A, to block DENV NS2B-NS3 protease. The inhibition potencies of the peptides were evaluated using in-house DENV2 serine protease and fluorogenic peptide substrates. In vitro analyses were performed to determine the peptides cytotoxicity and the inhibitory effects against DENV2 replication in WRL-68 cells. Our computational analyses revealed that the docking energy of AYA3, a 16 amino acid (aa) (-81.2 ± 10.6 kcal/mol) and AYA9, a 15 aa peptide (-83.8 ± 6.8 kcal/mol) to DENV NS2B-NS3 protease were much lower than the reference peptide (46 aa; -70.9 ± 7.8 kcal/mol) and the standard protease inhibitor, aprotinin (58 aa; -48.2 ± 10.6 kcal/mol). Both peptides showed significant inhibition against DENV2 NS2B-NS3 protease activity with IC50 values of 24 µM and 23 µM, respectively. AYA3 and AYA9 peptides also demonstrated approximately 68% and 83% of viral plaque reduction without significantly affecting cell viability at 50 µM concentration. In short, we generated short linear peptides with lower cytotoxic effect and substantial antiviral activities against DENV2. Further studies are required to investigate the inhibitory effects of these peptides in vivo. Keywords: peptide inhibitors; dengue virus; NS2B-NS3 protease; plaque reduction. <br>	1468	270	11
Serum LPS Associated with Hantavirus and Dengue Disease Severity in Barbados.	Hantavirus and dengue virus (DENV) infections are caused by RNA viruses which infect immune systems' cells including monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells and occur year-round in Barbados. A retrospective serological study (2008-2015) was conducted on hantavirus and dengue patient sera confirmed by IgM and IgG ELISA, NS1 and RT-PCR using Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) kinetic turbidimetric method to determine serum endotoxin levels. Hantavirus patients were categorized into two groups, namely (a) hospitalized and (b) non-hospitalized. Dengue patients were categorized into 3 groups using 2009 WHO dengue guidelines (a) severe dengue (SD), (b) hospitalized non-severe dengue (non-SD) and (c) non-hospitalized non-SD. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the association of endotoxin levels with hantavirus disease severity based on hospitalization and dengue disease severity. Serum endotoxin levels are associated with hantavirus disease severity and hospitalization and dengue disease severity (p < 0.01). Similar studies have found an association of serum endotoxin levels with dengue disease severity but never with hantavirus infection. Co-detection of hantavirus- and DENV-specific IgM in some patients were observed with elevated serum endotoxin levels. In addition, previous studies observed hantavirus replication in the gut of patients, gastrointestinal tract as a possible entry route of infection and evidence of microbial translocation and its impact on hantavirus disease severity. A significant correlation of serum endotoxin and hantavirus disease severity and hospitalization in hantavirus infected patients is reported for the first time ever. In addition, serum endotoxin levels correlated with dengue disease severity. This study adds further support to the role of endotoxin in both hantavirus and dengue virus infection and disease severity and its role as a possible therapeutic target for viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs). <br>	1701	286	12
Lessons Learned from Dengue Surveillance and Research, Puerto Rico, 1899-2013.	Dengue was first reported in Puerto Rico in 1899 and sporadically thereafter. Following outbreaks in 1963 and 1969, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has worked closely with the Puerto Rico Department of Health to monitor and reduce the public health burden of dengue. During that time, evolving epidemiologic scenarios have provided opportunities to establish, improve, and expand disease surveillance and interventional research projects. These initiatives have enriched the tools available to the global public health community to understand and combat dengue, including diagnostic tests, methods for disease and vector surveillance, and vector control techniques. Our review serves as a guide to organizations seeking to establish dengue surveillance and research programs by highlighting accomplishments, challenges, and lessons learned during more than a century of dengue surveillance and research conducted in Puerto Rico. <br>	816	135	5
Differences in the Transmission of Dengue Fever by Different Serotypes of Dengue Virus.	Dengue fever is the most common arbovirus in the world, and all four serotypes are infectious and pathogenic, but dengue virus (DENV)-1 and DENV-2 are the most prevalent in Guangdong Province. To investigate the differences in serotypes, we evaluated the replication, pathogenicity, and NS1 expression of DENV-2 and DENV-3 in cells, and further investigated the effects of NS1 on viral replication and transmission. The results of this study indicated that DENV-2 replicated faster and was more pathogenic than DENV-3. In Vero cells, DENV-2 secreted more NS1 protein than DENV-3, and NS1 protein promoted the infection of Aedes albopictus and A. aegypti by DENV. The spread of DENV and the severity of the disease depend on many factors. Further research on the differences between different serotypes of DENV will help us understand the epidemiology of DENV infection. This will provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of the dengue epidemic. <br>	816	161	8
Ocular manifestations of dengue.	<b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are an increasing number of publications related to dengue ophthalmic manifestations and multimodality imaging related to dengue. This review summarizes the current literature, describe ocular manifestations, current using of ocular imaging/investigations, and management of ocular dengue. <br><b>RECENT FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOcular manifestations of dengue can be present in many stages of dengue fever including after the resolution of systemic disease. Most cases of ocular dengue will exhibit an improvement in vision spontaneously over time. Multimodal imaging such as optical coherence tomography, optical coherence tomography angiography, near-infrared imaging, and microperimetry plays an important role in the diagnosis, follow-up, quantitative measure, and help to understand the disease progression. <br><b>SUMMARY:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever can lead to a variety of ocular manifestations. The mechanisms underlying dengue-related ocular complications remain unclear. Immune-mediated mechanisms and direct viral invasion are thought to play an important role. Ophthalmologists should carefully assess patients with dengue-related ophthalmic disease because some patients may have poor visual acuity and exhibit refractoriness to treatment. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids may benefit those patients with poor presenting visual acuity, progressive ocular symptoms, and lesions involving the optic nerve and/or threatening the macula. <br>	1214	392	10
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy (PRES) in a Child with Severe Dengue.	Among neurological complications associated with dengue, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has not been reported in pediatric population. We report a 10-year-old girl with severe dengue who developed PRES. The patient presented with hemorrhagic shock that required fluid resuscitation and inotropic support. She developed seizures with encephalopathy 2 days after recovering from the shock. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was negative for dengue (no white blood cells in CSF with negative polymerase chain reaction for dengue). Her clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings showed typical changes associated with posterior encephalopathy that reverted after resolution of hypertension. Repeat MRI after a month was normal. PRES should be considered as a possible differential diagnoses of dengue associated encephalopathy, especially in cases with normal CSF examination and characteristic MRI changes. <br>	827	132	8
Analyzing the control of dengue by releasing Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes through a delay differential equation model.	To date, an innovative strategy to control dengue is to release Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes into wild areas to sterilize wild female mosquito vectors by cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). To investigate the efficacy of Wolbachia in blocking dengue virus transmission, we develop a deterministic mathematical model of human and mosquito populations in which one dengue serotype circulates. The delay differential equation model captures the respective extrinsic and intrinsic incu-bation periods (EIP and IIP) in the mosquito and human, as well as the maturation delay between mating and emergence of adult mosquitoes, which have received relatively little attention. We analyze the existence and stability of disease-free equilibria, and obtain a sufficient and necessary condition on the existence of the disease-endemic equilibrium. We also determine two threshold values of the release ratio $\theta$, denoted by $\theta_1^*$ and $\theta_2^*$ with $\theta_1^*>\theta_2^*$. When $\theta>\theta_1^*$, the mosquito population will be eradicated eventually. When $\theta_2^*<\theta < \theta_1^*$, a complete mosquito eradication becomes impossible, but virus eradication is ensured at the meantime. When $\theta<\theta_2^*$, the disease-endemic equilibrium emerges that allows dengue virus to circulate between humans and mosquitoes. We carry out sensitivity analysis of the threshold values in terms of the model parameters, and simulate several possible control strate-gies with different release ratios, which confirm the public awareness that reducing mosquito bites and killing adult mosquitoes are the most effective strategy to control the epidemic. Our model provides new insights on the effectiveness of Wolbachia in reducing dengue at a population level. <br>	1532	254	10
Implication of sexual transmission of Zika on dengue and Zika outbreaks.	Dengue and Zika viruses belong to the same Flavivirus family and usually cocirculate within the same area. Both the viruses can be transmitted by a common mosquito species Aedes aegypti. However, non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, such as sexual transmission and vertical transmission, has been reported in recent studies. In this study, we develop a dengue-Zika coinfection model with a particular focus on the impact of Zika sexual transmission to the transmission dynamics of both dengue and Zika. Our sensitivity analysis shows that Zika sexual transmission has a significant influence on the Zika basic reproduction number. Consequently, Zika sexual transmission can lead Zika to be endemic within an area where vector-borne transmission only cannot. Theoretically, we prove that the disease-free equilibrium for dengue only model is always globally stable if the dengue basic reproduction number is less than 1. However, our cascade analysis and numerical simulations show that increasing the sexual transmission coefficient of Zika can also result in the persistence of dengue even though the dengue basic reproduction number is less than 1, due to the cocirculation of dengue and Zika and the antibody-dependent enhancement of Zika infection for dengue infection. Our numerical analyses also show that the endemic levels of Zika increase as the Zika sexual transmission probability increases. <br>	1205	219	9
A mathematical model to study the 2014-2015 large-scale dengue epidemics in Kaohsiung and Tainan cities in Taiwan, China.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection is endemic in many places of the tropical and subtropical regions, which poses serious public health threat globally. We develop and analyze a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of the dengue epidemics. Our qualitative analyzes show that the model has two equilibria, namely the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) which is locally asymp- totically stable when the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than one and unstable if R0 > 1, and endemic equilibrium (EE) which is globally asymp-totically stable when R0 > 1. Further analyzes reveals that the model exhibit the phenomena of backward bifurcation (BB) (a situation where a stable DFE co-exists with a stable EE even when the R0 > 1), which makes the disease control more diffi-cult. The model is applied to the real dengue epidemic data in Kaohsiung and Tainan cities in Taiwan, China to evaluate the fitting performance. We propose two reconstruction approaches to estimate the time-dependent R0 , and we find a consistent fitting results and equivalent goodness-of-fit. Our findings highlight the similarity of the dengue outbreaks in the two cities. We find that despite the proximity in Kaohsiung and Tainan cities, the estimated transmission rates are neither completely synchronized, nor periodically in-phase perfectly in the two cities. We also show the time lags between the seasonal waves in the two cities likely occurred. It is further shown via sensitivity analysis result that proper sanitation of the mosquito breeding sites and avoiding the mosquito bites are the key control measures to future dengue outbreaks in Taiwan. <br>	1390	263	10
Biological view of vaccination described by mathematical modellings: from rubella to dengue vaccines.	The only rubella vaccine available in North America is the RA27/3 strain (isolated from the kidney of a rubella-infected fetus and attenuated) licensed in 1979, which substituted HPV77/DE5 strain vaccine due to concerns about waning immunity. The first dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia CYDTDV) was first registered in Mexico in December, 2015, which is a live recombinant tetravalent dengue vaccine. Rubella vaccine was applied since 1969, but tetravalent dengue vaccine is being used in large scale nowadays. In the past, based on unavailable information regarded to rubella vaccine, mathematical models were used to design vaccination schemes in order to avoid congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Currently, knowing that vaccine does not result in CRS, rubella vaccination is modelled as usual childhood infection. This experience of updated biological knowledge that influenced mathematical modellings of rubella vaccination is taken into account to reflect about the tetravalent dengue vaccine. We also address a discussion about the security of vaccination strategies. <br>	917	159	7

Estimating the burden of dengue and the impact of release of wMel Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Indonesia: a modelling study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWolbachia-infected mosquitoes reduce dengue virus transmission, and city-wide releases in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia, are showing promising entomological results. Accurate estimates of the burden of dengue, its spatial distribution and the potential impact of Wolbachia are critical in guiding funder and government decisions on its future wider use. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere, we combine multiple modelling methods for burden estimation to predict national case burden disaggregated by severity and map the distribution of burden across the country using three separate data sources. An ensemble of transmission models then predicts the estimated reduction in dengue transmission following a nationwide roll-out of wMel Wolbachia. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe estimate that 7.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.8-17.7 million) symptomatic dengue cases occurred in Indonesia in 2015 and were associated with 332,865 (UI 94,175-754,203) lost disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The majority of dengue's burden was due to non-severe cases that did not seek treatment or were challenging to diagnose in outpatient settings leading to substantial underreporting. Estimated burden was highly concentrated in a small number of large cities with 90% of dengue cases occurring in 15.3% of land area. Implementing a nationwide Wolbachia population replacement programme was estimated to avert 86.2% (UI 36.2-99.9%) of cases over a long-term average. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese results suggest interventions targeted to the highest burden cities can have a disproportionate impact on dengue burden. Area-wide interventions, such as Wolbachia, that are deployed based on the area covered could protect people more efficiently than individual-based interventions, such as vaccines, in such dense environments. <br>	1501	720	10
Differential response to plant- and human-derived odorants in field surveillance of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti.	Linalool oxide (LO) and hexanoic acid (HA) represent plant- and human-derived odorants, respectively, previously found as attractants for the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. Here, we investigated if a blend of both compounds can improve captures of this mosquito species in field trials in two dengue endemic sites, Kilifi and Busia Counties in Kenya. Ae. aegypti captures were significantly higher in Kilifi than Busia (χ21,142 = 170.63, P < 0.0001) and varied by treatments (χ25,137 = 151.19, P = 0.002). We found that CO2-baited BG Sentinel traps combined with a blend of both odorants decreased Ae. aegypti captures about 2- to 4-fold compared to captures with the individual compounds (LO or HA) used as positive controls. This was the case for all blends of LO and HA, irrespective of the doses tested. Our findings indicate that combining plant- and human-derived odors may elicit a masking effect in trapping Ae. aegypti. These results partly corroborate previous findings for malaria mosquitoes which showed that combining lures from both host sources either decreases or increases trap catches depending on the dose. Further investigations in the usefulness of combining plant and animal odorants in mosquito trapping are therefore necessary. <br>	1061	202	11
Hijacking the Host Immune Cells by Dengue Virus: Molecular Interplay of Receptors and Dengue Virus Envelope.	Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the lethal pathogens in the hot climatic regions of the world and has been extensively studied to decipher its mechanism of pathogenesis and the missing links of its life cycle. With respect to the entry of DENV, multiple receptors have been recognized in different cells of the human body. However, scientists still argue whether these identified receptors are the exclusive entry mediators for the virus. Adding to the complexity, DENV has been reported to be infecting multiple organ types in its human host. Also, more than one receptor in a particular cell has been discerned to take part in mediating the ingress of DENV. In this review, we aim to discuss the different cells of the human immune system that support DENV infection and their corresponding receptors that DENV deploy to gain access to the cells. <br>	710	144	6

Dengue hemorrhagic fever presenting as encephalitis: a case report.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever incidence is increasing in Sri Lanka, especially among the young population. Uncommon presentations of this common illness make diagnostic dilemmas and can delay standard treatment which leads to unfavorable outcomes. <br><b>CASE PRESENTATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn 18-year-old Sri Lankan Sinhalese boy presented with a history of 1 day of fever and an episode of seizure followed by left-side hemiparesis. He was diagnosed to have dengue complicated by dengue hemorrhagic fever and recovered with minimal residual weakness. He presented with neurological symptoms; cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalogram, and magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of encephalitis. Positive dengue antigen and antibody in serum and cerebrospinal fluid with the exclusion of other possible etiologies confirmed parainfectious dengue encephalitis. He was started on sodium valproate 200 mg 8 hourly and made a slow neurological recovery with mild residual weakness (grade 4+ power) in his left upper limb at 2 months with intensive supervised physiotherapy. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStandard national guideline-based management of dengue illness has significantly reduced its mortality rates in Sri Lanka. However, uncommon presentations of a common illness often cause diagnostic dilemmas. Hence, reporting of these presentations and knowing the epidemiologic patterns of the disease help physicians to arrive at the correct diagnosis even though they do not have sophisticated serological investigations. Overall, this can improve the quality of health care and reduce mortalities, especially in a resource-poor setup. <br>	1370	471	11
Applying fuzzy logic to assess the biogeographical risk of dengue in South America.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOver the last decade, reports about dengue cases have increase worldwide, which is particularly worrisome in South America due to the historic record of dengue outbreaks from the seventeenth century until the first half of the twentieth century. Dengue is a viral disease that involves insect vectors, namely Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, which implies that, to prevent and combat outbreaks, it is necessary to understand the set of ecological and biogeographical factors affecting both the vector species and the virus. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe contribute with a methodology based on fuzzy logic that is helpful to disentangle the main factors that determine favorable environmental conditions for vectors and diseases. Using favorability functions as fuzzy logic modelling technique and the fuzzy intersection, union and inclusion as fuzzy operators, we were able to specify the territories at biogeographical risk of dengue outbreaks in South America. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur results indicate that the distribution of Ae. aegypti mostly encompasses the biogeographical framework of dengue in South America, which suggests that this species is the principal vector responsible for the geographical extent of dengue cases in the continent. Nevertheless, the intersection between the favorability for dengue cases and the union of the favorability for any of the vector species provided a comprehensive map of the biogeographical risk for dengue. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFuzzy logic is an appropriate conceptual and operational tool to tackle the nuances of the vector-illness biogeographical interaction. The application of fuzzy logic may be useful in decision-making by the public health authorities to prevent, control and mitigate vector-borne diseases. <br>	1450	771	10
Dengue and chikungunya among outpatients with acute undifferentiated fever in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo: A cross-sectional study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPathogens causing acute fever, with the exception of malaria, remain largely unidentified in sub-Saharan Africa, given the local unavailability of diagnostic tests and the broad differential diagnosis. <br><b>METHODOLOGY:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe conducted a cross-sectional study including outpatient acute undifferentiated fever in both children and adults, between November 2015 and June 2016 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests for selected arboviral infections were performed on blood, including PCR, NS1-RDT, ELISA and IFA for acute, and ELISA and IFA for past infections. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInvestigation among 342 patients, aged 2 to 68 years (mean age of 21 years), with acute undifferentiated fever (having no clear focus of infection) revealed 19 (8.1%) acute dengue-caused by DENV-1 and/or DENV-2 -and 2 (0.9%) acute chikungunya infections. Furthermore, 30.2% and 26.4% of participants had been infected in the past with dengue and chikungunya, respectively. We found no evidence of acute Zika nor yellow fever virus infections. 45.3% of patients tested positive on malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test, 87.7% received antimalarial treatment and 64.3% received antibacterial treatment. <br><b>DISCUSSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChikungunya outbreaks have been reported in the study area in the past, so the high seroprevalence is not surprising. However, scarce evidence exists on dengue transmission in Kinshasa and based on our data, circulation is more important than previously reported. Furthermore, our study shows that the prescription of antibiotics, both antibacterial and antimalarial drugs, is rampant. Studies like this one, elucidating the causes of acute fever, may lead to a more considerate and rigorous use of antibiotics. This will not only stem the ever-increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance, but will-ultimately and hopefully-improve the clinical care of outpatients in low-resource settings. <br><b>TRIAL REGISTRATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClinicalTrials.gov NCT02656862. <br>	1640	999	12
A Graph-Based Approach for Finding the Dengue Infection Pathways in Humans Using Protein-Protein Interactions.	                     Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the deadly arboviruses, which is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti, and causes dengue infection to the humans. According to WHO, every year around 390 million humans are affected by DENV, of which around 50 million deaths are reported. Knowledge of the various diseases caused by the DENV would greatly encourage to understand the infection mechanism and help to design new antiviral drug discovery. We propose a quasi-clique and quasi-biclique algorithm to classify infection gateway proteins of the human body and possible pathways of DENV leading to various diseases. For this, we have examined three networks, dengue-human protein-protein interaction network, human protein interaction network, and human proteins-disease association network. The prediction result states that DENV may lead to various diseases in the human body, including cancer, asthma, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, premature birth, and so on. Some of the results have recently been validated experimentally. This study may endow with potential targets for more effective anti-dengue remedial contribution.                  <br>	968	171	8
Predictive Models for the Medical Diagnosis of Dengue: A Case Study in Paraguay.	Early diagnosis of dengue continues to be a concern for public health in countries with a high incidence of this disease. In this work, we compared two machine learning techniques: artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) as assistance tools for medical diagnosis. The performance of classification models was evaluated in a real dataset of patients with a previous diagnosis of dengue extracted from the public health system of Paraguay during the period 2012-2016. The ANN multilayer perceptron achieved better results with an average of 96% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and 97% specificity, with low variation in thirty different partitions of the dataset. In comparison, SVM polynomial obtained results above 90% for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. <br>	673	120	4
Clinical prognostic models for severe dengue: a systematic review protocol.	Background: Dengue is a common mosquito-borne, with high morbidity rates recorded in the annual. Dengue contributes to a major disease burden in many tropical countries. This demonstrates the urgent need in developing effective approaches to identify severe cases early. For this purpose, many multivariable prognostic models using multiple prognostic variables were developed to predict the risk of progression to severe outcomes. The aim of the planned systematic review is to identify and describe the existing clinical multivariable prognostic models for severe dengue as well as examine the possibility of combining them. These findings will suggest directions for further research of this field. Methods: This protocol has followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P). We will conduct a comprehensive search of Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria include being published in peer-review journals, focusing on human subjects and developing the multivariable prognostic model for severe dengue, without any restriction on language, location and period of publication, and study design. The reference list will be captured and removed from duplications. We will use the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) checklist to extract data and Prediction study risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) to assess the study quality. Discussion: This systematic review will describe the existing prediction models, summarize the current status of prognostic research on dengue, and report the possibility to combine the models to optimize the power of each paradigm.

Vertical transmission of dengue virus in Aedes aegypti and its role in the epidemiological persistence of dengue in Central and Southern Mexico.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the main mosquito species responsible for dengue virus (DENV) transmission to humans in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The role of vertical transmission in the epidemiology of dengue and the maintenance of this arbovirus in nature during interepidemic periods remain poorly understood, and DENV vertical transmission could sustain the existence of virus reservoirs within Aedes populations. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBetween April 2011 to October 2012 we monitored vertical transmission of DENV in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in 9 cities of 4 Mexican states. Aedes eggs were collected in ovitraps, then adults were reared under laboratory conditions and their heads were used to infect C6/36 cells. The presence of flavivirus was detected by immunofluorescence assays (IFA) and DENV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp96% of reared adults were Ae. aegypti and 4.0% were Ae. albopictus. No infection was detected in Ae. albopictus, whereas 54 of 713 (7.8%) of Ae. aegypti pools tested positive. A minimum infection rate (MIR) of 2.52 per 1000 mosquitoes was estimated for Ae. aegypti. DENV-1, DENV-2 & DENV-3 serotypes were detected even during interepidemic periods. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study reports the evidence of vertical transmission of dengue virus with viral isolation and molecular confirmation in Ae. aegypti eggs collected in four endemic regions of Central and Southern Mexico. Vertical transmission may play a role as a reservoir mechanism during mosquito dormancy in interepidemic periods but with minor participation in transmission during epidemic periods.

Modelling the Effect of a Novel Autodissemination Trap on the Spread of Dengue in Shah Alam and Malaysia.	In this paper, we will start off by introducing the classical Ross-Macdonald model for vector-borne diseases which we use to describe the transmission of dengue between humans and Aedes mosquitoes in Shah Alam, which is a city and the state capital of Selangor, Malaysia. We will focus on analysing the effect of using the Mosquito Home System (MHS), which is an example of an autodissemination trap, in reducing the number of dengue cases by changing the Ross-Macdonald model. By using the national dengue data from Malaysia, we are able to estimate λ, which represents the initial growth rate of the dengue epidemic, and this allows us to estimate the number of mosquitoes in Malaysia. A mathematical expression is also constructed which allows us to estimate the potential number of breeding sites of Aedes mosquitoes. By using the data available from the MHS trial carried out in Section 15 of Shah Alam, we included the potential effect of the MHS into the dengue model and thus modelled the impact MHS has on the spread of dengue within the trial area. We then extended our results to analyse the effect of the MHSs on reducing the number of dengue cases in the whole of Malaysia. A new model was constructed with a basic reproduction number, R0,MalaMHS, which allows us to identify the required MHSs coverage needed to achieve extinction in Malaysia. Numerical simulations and tables of results were also produced to illustrate our results. <br>	1211	248	8
Contribution of Toll like receptor polymorphisms to dengue susceptibility and clinical outcome among eastern Indian patients.	Dengue infection has been one of the major public health concerns in India causing simple dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue infection. In the present study, contribution of TLR3, 7 and 8 polymorphisms towards dengue disease susceptibility and severity among Eastern Indian patients was analysed. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood of 201 dengue infected patients and 157 healthy individuals, followed by genotyping of eight polymorphisms of TLR3 (rs3775290), TLR7 (rs5741880, rs3853839, rs179008 and rs179010) and TLR8 (rs3764879, rs3764880 and rs5744080) genes by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Functional analyses of the polymorphisms were predicted. Genotypic association of polymorphisms, alone and in combination, with dengue disease susceptibility and development of WHO-defined warning signs among patients was calculated by using SPSS software. TLR7-rs179008 & TLR8-rs3764880 were implicated to be non-synonymous polymorphisms. Specific genotypes of majority of the analysed TLR polymorphisms exhibited significant positive association with disease susceptibility. CC/C and AA/A of TLR7-rs179008 (p < 0.0001) and TLR8-rs3764880 (p < 0.00001) respectively were significantly associated with development of warning signs among dengue infected patients. Particular genotypic combinations of rs3853839-rs5744080 and rs179008-rs3764880 increased the risk of dengue infectivity, whereas, presence of last combination was more prevalent among dengue patients with warning signs. Thus these polymorphic variants of TLR3, 7 and 8 might act as potential prognostic biomarkers for predicting disease severity among dengue virus infected patients. <br>	1475	238	10
A protective Zika virus E-dimer-based subunit vaccine engineered to abrogate antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue infection.	Infections with dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) can induce cross-reactive antibody responses. Two immunodominant epitopes-one to precursor membrane protein and one to the fusion loop epitope on envelope (E) protein-are recognized by cross-reactive antibodies1-3 that are not only poorly neutralizing, but can also promote increased viral replication and disease severity via Fcγ receptor-mediated infection of myeloid cells-a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)1,4,5. ADE is a significant concern for both ZIKV and DENV vaccines as the induction of poorly neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies may prime an individual for ADE on natural infection. In this report, we describe the design and production of covalently stabilized ZIKV E dimers, which lack precursor membrane protein and do not expose the immunodominant fusion loop epitope. Immunization of mice with ZIKV E dimers induces dimer-specific antibodies, which protect against ZIKV challenge during pregnancy. Importantly, the ZIKV E-dimer-induced response does not cross-react with DENV or induce ADE of DENV infection. <br>	957	172	6

Gravid oviposition sticky trap and dengue non-structural 1 antigen test for early surveillance of dengue in multi-storey dwellings: study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is a global disease, transmitted by the Aedes vectors. In 2018, there were 80 615 dengue cases with 147 deaths in Malaysia. Currently, the nationwide surveillance programs are dependent on Aedes larval surveys and notifications of lab-confirmed human infections. The existing, reactive programs appear to lack sensitivity and proactivity. More efficient dengue vector surveillance/control methods are needed. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA parallel, cluster, randomized controlled, interventional trial is being conducted for 18 months in Damansara Damai, Selangor, Malaysia, to determine the efficacy of using gravid oviposition sticky (GOS) trap and dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) antigen test for early surveillance of dengue among Aedes mosquitoes to reduce dengue outbreaks. Eight residential apartments were randomly assigned into intervention and control arms. GOS traps are set at the apartments to collect Aedes weekly, following which dengue NS1 antigen is detected in these mosquitoes. When a dengue-positive mosquito is detected, the community will be advised to execute vector search-and-destroy and protective measures. The primary outcome concerns the the percentage change in the (i) number of dengue cases and (ii) durations of dengue outbreaks. Whereas other outcome measures include the change in density threshold of Aedes and changes in dengue-related knowledge, attitude and practice among cluster inhabitants. <br><b>DISCUSSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a proactive and early dengue surveillance in the mosquito vector that does not rely on notification of dengue cases. Surveillance using the GOS traps should be able to efficiently provide sufficient coverage for multistorey dwellings where population per unit area is likely to be higher. Furthermore, trapping dengue-infected mosquitoes using the GOS trap, helps to halt the dengue transmission carried by the mosquito. It is envisaged that the results of this randomized controlled trial will provide a new proactive, cheap and targeted surveillance tool for the prevention and control of dengue outbreaks. <br><b>TRIAL REGISTRATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a parallel-cluster, randomized controlled, interventional trial, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT03799237), on 8th January 2019 (retrospectively registered). <br>	1893	977	16
Expression Pattern of Selected Toll-like Receptors (TLR's) in the PBMC's of Severe and Non-severe Dengue Cases.	Objective: The role of TLR's in the pathogenesis of dengue is not explored well. Differential expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was reported in dengue cases. In the present study in order to understand the expression pattern of various TLR's, including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR9, mRNA levels were determined in various dengue study groups compared to control groups, at the time of admission and around defervescence using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Methods: A total of 88 dengue cases with 32 severe and 56 non-severe cases were involved in the study. Gene expression pattern of the study groups was compared with 31 other febrile illness (OFI) cases and 63 healthy controls. Transcript levels of the target genes were estimated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples collected from cases and controls using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: We have noted a significant alteration in the levels of all TLR's in dengue and OFI cases compared to healthy controls at the time of admission. Interestingly we have noted a significant alteration in the levels of TLR9 in severe and non-severe cases during defervescence. The same was not detected in the OFI group. Conclusion: The present study found a change in TLR's during dengue infection. This suggests us to explore the TLR's as therapeutic candidate for anti-dengue virus strategies. However, in order to ascertain the involvement of TLR's in the disease pathology and its role as biomarkers for prognosis, a complete dynamics of TLR's expression needs to be studied. <br>	1306	261	12
Dengue virus serotype-4 during the 2015-2017 epidemic: emergence of a novel genotype IIa of DENV-4 in the Philippines.	Dengue remains a major public health problem in the Philippines. Here, we determined the circulating serotypes in the Philippines during the 2015-2017 outbreaks by using a total of 678 serum samples that were collected from 537 individual dengue patients. Following an increase in the percentage of DENV-4 patients in recent years, we conducted a comprehensive molecular epidemiology analysis on the DENV-4 strains isolated recently in the Philippines. While two genotypes of DENV-4 have been isolated in the Philippines since 1956, the GI and GIIa which were the DENV-4 strains isolated in this study were closely related to a distinct group of GIIa strains that were isolated from the Philippines since 2004. A majority of the isolates of this sub-group has been identified in the Philippines, suggesting that the lineage may have been introduced and evolved in the Philippines to form the distinct sub-group within GIIa strains. The increase in DENV-4 activity also coincided with the appearance of GIIa sub-group and the phasing-out of GI lineage in the Philippines. Overall, our study demonstrates a shift in DENV-4 genotype and epidemic dynamics in a hyperendemic region, suggesting the importance of DENV genetic evolution in establishing and sustaining transmission. <br>	1084	209	6
Two cases of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) infection in a Japanese couple returning from Maldives in the dengue outbreak in 2018.	Annually, more than 1.2 million travelers from other countries visit Maldives for sightseeing, business and honeymoons. In 2018, the largest dengue fever outbreak occurred and more than 3,200 people were affected. During this outbreak, we encountered a newly married Japanese couple returning from Maldives on their honeymoon in October 2018, both of which got infected by dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) during the travel. The number of imported dengue fever cases from Maldives may increase, hence, physicians should keep a sharp watch on up-to-date dengue outbreak information all over the world. <br>	511	98	4
Formation of Virus-Like Particles of the Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Expressed in Silkworm Larvae.	To explore virus-like particles formation of dengue virus serotype type 2 (DENV-2) structural proteins of, C, prM, E were expressed in silkworm larvae using recombinant Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedroviruses (BmNPV). Each recombinant BmNPV bacmid coding the 2C-prM-E polypeptide and E protein fused with the signal peptide of bombyxin from B. mori was injected into silkworm larvae. The expressed proteins were collected from hemolymph and fat body, and purified using affinity chromatography. E protein was observed at 55 kDa. The DENV virus-like particles (DENV-LPs) with a diameter approximately 35 nm was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunogold-labelling TEM analysis. The binding of each partially purified proteins to heparin, one of receptors for DENV was confirmed. DENV-LPs were secreted in silkworm larval hemolymph even still low amount, but the E protein and heparin binding function were confirmed. <br>	806	146	8
Influence of directional positive Darwinian selection-driven evolution on arboviruses Dengue and Zika virulence and pathogenesis.	Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are antigenically and evolutionarily related; immunological cross-reactions between them have been associated to both cross-protection and infection-enhanced mechanisms. Here, DENV-1-4 and ZIKV were investigated through Bayesian coalescent-based approaches and selection-driven Darwinian evolution methods using robust datasets. Our findings show that both DENV and ZIKV, driven essentially by directional positive selection, have undergone evolution and diversification and that their entire polyproteins are subject to an intense directional evolution. Interestingly, positively selected codons mapped here are directly associated to DENV-1-2 virulence as well as the ZIKV burgeoning 2015-16 outbreak in the Americas, therefore, having impact on the pathogenesis of these viruses. Biochemical prediction analysis focusing on markers involved in virulence and viral transmission dynamics identified alterations in N-Glycosylation-, Phosphorylation- and Palmitoylation-sites in ZIKV sampled from different countries, hosts and isolation sources. Taking into account both DENV-ZIKV co-circulation either into and/or out of flavivirus-endemic regions, as well as recombination and quasispecies scenarios, these results indicate the action of a selection-driven evolution affecting the biology, virulence and pathogenesis of these pathogens in a non-randomized environment. <br>	1237	197	6
De novo design approaches targeting an envelope protein pocket to identify small molecules against dengue virus.	Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has become a major public health concern worldwide. This disease presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from a mild cold-like illness to the more serious hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome. Currently, neither an approved drug nor an effective vaccine for the treatment are available to fight the disease. The envelope protein (E) is a major component of the virion surface. This protein plays a key role during the viral entry process, constituting an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. The crystal structure of the E protein reveals the existence of a hydrophobic pocket occupied by the detergent n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (β-OG). This pocket lies at the hinge region between domains I and II and is important for the low pH-triggered conformational rearrangement required for the fusion of the virion with the host's cell. Aiming at the design of novel molecules which bind to E and act as virus entry inhibitors, we undertook a de novo design approach by "growing" molecules inside the hydrophobic site (β-OG). From more than 240000 small-molecules generated, the 2,4 pyrimidine scaffold was selected as the best candidate, from which one synthesized compound displayed micromolar activity. Molecular dynamics-based optimization was performed on this hit, and thirty derivatives were designed in silico, synthesized and evaluated on their capacity to inhibit dengue virus entry into the host cell. Four compounds were found to be potent antiviral compounds in the low-micromolar range. The assessment of drug-like physicochemical and in vitro pharmacokinetic properties revealed that compounds 3e and 3h presented acceptable solubility values and were stable in mouse plasma, simulated gastric fluid, simulated intestinal fluid, and phosphate buffered saline solution. <br>	1599	298	12
Clinical relevance of gallbladder wall thickening for dengue severity: A cross-sectional study.	Dengue fever is the most important arthropod-borne viral infection worldwide. Secondary prevention to reduce mortality through improved clinical case management has substantially lowered the mortality rate for severe dengue during the past two decades. Gallbladder wall thickening (GBWT) is a nonspecific finding often associated with more severe cases of dengue infection. This study had the aim to describe the ultrasonographic findings in hospitalized patients with dengue infection from Manaus (in the Western Brazilian Amazon) and to correlate the GBWT with dengue severity, symptoms and laboratorial analysis. Patients from 13-84 years admitted to the emergency department at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) were enrolled in this study. Patients' selection occurred during the most recent and huge dengue outbreak within the first semester of 2011. All enrolled subjects were systematically tested in order to rule out other possible etiologies for gallbladder inflammation. Abdominal ultrasound was performed by a single physician through bedside portable equipment and all other clinical and laboratorial information were retrieved from patients' electronic files. 54 subjects were considered for analysis, with confirmed dengue infection by NS1 and/or RT-PCR positivity. From all enrolled patients, 50 (42.4%) presented GBWT. GBWT was significantly and independently related to: age under 31 years, pregnancy, presence of bleeding, presence of any cavitary effusion, DHF classification and severe dengue classifications. During dengue outbreaks, the GBWT identification through a non-invasive and bedside procedure is a confident marker for prompt recognition of potential severe cases. <br>	1497	251	12
Developing a Digital Solution for Dengue Through Epihack: Qualitative Evaluation Study of a Five-Day Health Hackathon in Sri Lanka.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has increasingly affected Sri Lanka in recent years. To address this issue, dengue surveillance through increasingly prevalent digital surveillance applications has been suggested for use by health authorities and the general public. Epihack Sri Lanka was a 5-day hackathon event organized to develop a digital dengue surveillance tool. <br><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe goal of the research was to examine the effectiveness of a collaborative hackathon that brought together information technology (IT) and health experts from around the globe to develop a solution to the dengue pandemic in Sri Lanka. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEthnographic observation and qualitative informal interviews were conducted with 58 attendees from 11 countries over the 5-day Epihack to identify the main factors that influence a collaborative hackathon. Interviews were transcribed and coded based on grounded theory. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThree major themes were identified during the Epihack Sri Lanka event: engagement, communication, and current disease environment. Unlike other hackathons, Epihack had no winners or prizes and was collaborative rather than competitive, which worked well in formulating a variety of ideas and bringing together volunteers with a sense of civic duty to improve public health. Having health and IT experts work together concurrently was received positively and considered highly beneficial to the development of the product. Participants were overall very satisfied with the event, although they thought it could have been longer. Communication issues and cultural differences were observed but continued to decrease as the event progressed. This was found to be extremely important to the efficiency of the event, which highlighted the benefit of team-bonding exercises. Bringing expert knowledge and examples of systems from around the world benefited the creation of new ideas. However, developing a system that can adapt and cater to the local disease environment is important in successfully developing the concepts. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEpihack Sri Lanka was successful in bringing together health and IT experts to develop a digital solution for dengue surveillance. The collaborative format achieved a variety of fruitful ideas and may lead to more hackathons working in this way in the future. Good communication, participant engagement, and stakeholder interest with adaptation of ideas to complement the current environment are vital to achieve the goals of the event. <br>	2089	1075	17
Twenty-Two years of dengue fever (1996-2017): an epidemiological study in a Brazilian city.	This ecological study analyzed the temporal pattern of clinically diagnosed and laboratory confirmed dengue cases in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil from 1996 to 2017. The study was divided into two analytical parts, the first of which evaluated the association between dengue incidence and host and climatic factors. The second part encompassed data from 2002 to 2017 and examined dengue incidence in relation to virus serotype and an intra-urban socioeconomic index. Over 22 years there were 469,171 cases and four epidemic peaks. There was an increase in the number, severity, and lethality of cases over the last 10 years of the study period. Biological and environmental factors appear to modulate the behavior of dengue in a large urban center. <br>	642	123	5
NK cells are activated and primed for skin-homing during acute dengue virus infection in humans.	Despite animal models showing that natural killer (NK) cells are important players in the early defense against many viral infections, the NK cell response is poorly understood in humans. Here we analyze the phenotype, temporal dynamics, regulation and trafficking of NK cells in a patient cohort with acute dengue virus infection. NK cells are robustly activated and proliferate during the first week after symptom debut. Increased IL-18 levels in plasma and in induced skin blisters of DENV-infected patients, as well as concomitant signaling downstream of the IL-18R, suggests an IL-18-dependent mechanism in driving the proliferative NK cell response. Responding NK cells have a less mature phenotype and a distinct chemokine-receptor imprint indicative of skin-homing. A corresponding NK cell subset can be localized to skin early during acute infection. These data provide evidence of an IL-18-driven NK cell proliferation and priming for skin-homing during an acute viral infection in humans. <br>	856	161	7
Haemolytic anaemia precipitated by dengue fever.	We reported a case of a woman with no past medical illness who presented with a few days' history of fever, myalgia, arthralgia, hypochromic microcytic anaemia and thrombocytopaenia and who was nonstructural protein 1 antigen (NS1Ag)-positive. Haemolytic anaemia including full blood picture work-up revealed high reticulocyte count and haemolysis with positive direct Coombs test. She was started on prednisolone and was discharged well. <br>	381	67	3
Contemporary Strategies and Current Trends in Designing Antiviral Drugs against Dengue Fever via Targeting Host-Based Approaches.	Dengue virus (DENV) is an arboviral human pathogen transmitted through mosquito bite that infects an estimated ~400 million humans (~5% of the global population) annually. To date, no specific therapeutics have been developed that can prevent or treat infections resulting from this pathogen. DENV utilizes numerous host molecules and factors for transcribing the single-stranded ~11 kb positive-sense RNA genome. For example, the glycosylation machinery of the host is required for viral particles to assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum. Since a variety of host factors seem to be utilized by the pathogens, targeting these factors may result in DENV inhibitors, and will play an important role in attenuating the rapid emergence of other flaviviruses. Many experimental studies have yielded findings indicating that host factors facilitate infection, indicating that the focus should be given to targeting the processes contributing to pathogenesis along with many other immune responses. Here, we provide an extensive literature review in order to elucidate the progress made in the development of host-based approaches for DENV viral infections, focusing on host cellular mechanisms and factors responsible for viral replication, aiming to aid the potential development of host-dependent antiviral therapeutics. <br>	1133	196	7
Immunogenicity and safety of a dengue vaccine given as a booster in Singapore: a randomized Phase II, placebo-controlled trial evaluating its effects 5-6 years after completion of the primary series.	The tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV; Dengvaxia®) is administered on a three-dose schedule, 6 months apart in those aged ≥9 years in a number of dengue-endemic countries in Asia and Latin America. In this study, CYD63 (NCT02824198), participants aged 9-45 years at first vaccination, and who had received three doses of CYD-TDV in the CYD28 study more than 5 years previously, were randomized 3:1 to receive a booster CYD-TDV dose (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2). Dengue neutralizing antibody geometric mean titres (PRNT50 GMTs) for each of the four dengue serotypes were assessed in sera collected before and 28 days after booster injections. Non-inferiority of the booster immune response versus that induced after the third dose was demonstrated for each serotype if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was >0.5 for the GMT ratios (GMTRs) between post-booster CYD-TDV dose and post-dose 3 in Group 1. Overall, 118 participants received CYD-TDV booster or placebo and 116 (98.3%) completed the study; two participants were withdrawn because of noncompliance. GMTs in the booster CYD-TDV group increased across all serotypes post-booster injection by 1.74- (serotype 1) to 3.58-fold (serotype 4). No discernible increases were observed in the placebo group. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for serotypes 1, 3 and 4, but not for serotype 2 (GMTR; 0.603 [95% CI, 0.439; 0.829]). No safety issues were observed. These data show that the CYD-TDV booster given 5 or more years later tended to restore GMTs back to levels observed post-dose 3. <br>	1327	274	10
Simultaneous detection of IgM antibodies against dengue and chikungunya: Coinfection or cross-reactivity?	<b>Background:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue and chikungunya sharing same mosquito vector are two most important arboviruses circulating in northern India including Delhi and are responsible for frequent outbreaks. Antigen and antibodies detection ELISA kits are the major tool to diagnose these viral illnesses, and are sometimes associated with cross-reactivity, giving a false picture of coinfection, although simultaneous harboring of both the viruses is not uncommon. Various studies have reported coinfection up to 25% from the same region. <br><b>Procedure:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, during the month of September 2016 which included 200 blood samples from clinically suspected cases attending Medicine OPD of associated Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi. Diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya was made using NS-1 antigen and IgM MAC ELISA for dengue and IgM MAC ELISA for chikungunya as per manufacturer's instructions. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOut of 200 suspected cases, 34 (17%) were positive for dengue serology, 77 (38.5%) were positive for chikungunya serology, and 29.9% of positive chikungunya cases were simultaneously affected with dengue. This higher percentage of coinfection might be because of cross-reactivity of the ELISA kits. <br><b>Discussion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIndia being a hyperendemic region for dengue and chikungunya, frequent outbreaks are quite common. Circulation of both the virus and huge susceptible population are the major causes for frequent outbreaks. Restricting our attention to diagnose one of them is not sufficient, and coinfection further complicates the illness. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSimultaneous diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya is need of time to diagnose dual infection and prevent complications by starting supportive treatment well in time. Molecular technique if ever possible should be employed whenever the coinfection number is higher than expected to rule out cross-reactivity. <br>	1602	1047	12
The eye in dengue fever, a rarely appreciated aspect of dengue expanded syndrome: a case report.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever is a mosquito-borne illness prevalent mainly in the tropics. It is feared for causing the dengue hemorrhagic spectrum of the disease leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Its rarer manifestations are categorized as the expanded dengue syndrome, and though being recognized, they are not fully appreciated and understood. The involvement of the eye in dengue fever is one such phenomenon. <br><b>CASE PRESENTATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA 27-year-old South-Asian woman presented on day 2 of dengue fever, without capillary leakage, for further management. Despite developing hepatitis, she had an otherwise uncomplicated progression of the illness because she did not develop capillary leakage. On day 8 of the illness, she had the lowest platelet count and developed bilateral blurred vision. Examination revealed that only gross movements were detected in the left eye, and the right eye had a visual acuity of 6/9. She was diagnosed with foveolitis in the right eye and central serous chorioretinopathy in the left eye, along with hemorrhages in both eyes. These were confirmed by funduscopy, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and macular scans. She received systemic and intravitreal steroids and was assessed regularly. After 6 months of observation, her visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye, which remained the same thereafter. <br><b>DISCUSSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe exact mechanism of eye involvement in dengue viral infection is poorly understood. Multiple causes have been suspected and include viral factors, immune mediation, capillary leakage, stress, and hemorrhage. Eye involvement is classically seen at the lowest platelet count and when the count begins to rise. Though symptoms are nonpathognomonic, blurring of vision is the commonest complaint, but the range of presentation is extensive and variable. Ophthalmological assessment and funduscopy are very useful in addition to advanced assessments. There is no clear consensus on management; suggestions range from conservative care to aggressive steroid therapy with immune modulation and even ophthalmological intervention. Recovery can be full or partial with a variable time scale. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe extensive spectrum of possible visual symptoms should prompt the clinician to suspect any visual complaint as potential dengue eye involvement. Guided studies and screening are needed to better understand the true incidence of eye involvement in dengue fever. <br>	2050	1058	21
A Dengue Virus Type 2 (DENV-2) NS4B-Interacting Host Factor, SERP1, Reduces DENV-2 Production by Suppressing Viral RNA Replication.	Host cells infected with dengue virus (DENV) often trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key process that allows viral reproduction, without killing the host cells until the late stage of the virus life-cycle. However, little is known regarding which DENV viral proteins interact with the ER machinery to support viral replication. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel host factor, stress-associated ER protein 1 (SERP1), which interacts with the DENV type 2 (DENV-2) NS4B protein by several assays, for example, yeast two-hybrid, subcellular localization, NanoBiT complementation, and co-immunoprecipitation. A drastic increase (34.5-fold) in the SERP1 gene expression was observed in the DENV-2-infected or replicon-transfected Huh7.5 cells. The SERP1 overexpression inhibited viral yields (37-fold) in the DENV-2-infected Huh7.5 cells. In contrast, shRNAi-knockdown and the knockout of SERP1 increased the viral yields (3.4- and 16-fold, respectively) in DENV-2-infected HEK-293 and Huh7.5 cells, respectively. DENV-2 viral RNA replication was severely reduced in stable SERP1-expressing Huh7.5 cells transfected with DENV-2 replicon plasmids. The overexpression of DENV-2 NS4B alleviated the inhibitory effect of SERP1 on DENV-2 RNA replication. Taking these results together, we hypothesized that SERP1 may serve as an antiviral player during ER stress to restrict DENV-2 infection. Our studies revealed novel anti-DENV drug targets that may facilitate anti-DENV drug discovery. <br>	1305	242	10
Chronic Dengue Virus Panencephalitis in a Patient with Progressive Dementia with Extrapyramidal Features.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo determine the underlying etiology in a patient with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal signs and chronic inflammation referred to the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExtensive investigations included metabolic profile, autoantibody panel, infectious etiologies, genetic screening, whole exome sequencing, and the phage-display assay, VirScan, for viral immune responses. An etiological diagnosis was established postmortem. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing VirScan, enrichment of dengue viral antibodies was detected in cerebrospinal fluid as compared to serum. No virus was detected in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, but postmortem analysis confirmed dengue virus in the brain by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing. Dengue virus was also detectable by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing from brain biopsy tissue collected 33 months antemortem, confirming a chronic infection despite a robust immune response directed against the virus. Immunoprofiling and whole exome sequencing of the patient did not reveal any immunodeficiency, and sequencing of the virus demonstrated wild-type dengue virus in the central nervous system. <br><b>INTERPRETATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue virus is the most common arbovirus worldwide and represents a significant public health concern. Infections with dengue virus are usually self-limiting, and chronic dengue infections have not been previously reported. Our findings suggest that dengue virus infections may persist in the central nervous system causing a panencephalitis and should be considered in patients with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal features in endemic regions or with relevant travel history. Furthermore, this work highlights the utility of comprehensive antibody profiling assays to aid in the diagnosis of encephalitis of unknown etiology. ANN NEUROL 2019. <br>	1613	585	11
Dengue Non-structural Protein 5 Polymerase Complexes With Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein (PML) Isoforms III and IV to Disrupt PML-Nuclear Bodies in Infected Cells.	Dengue virus (DENV) threatens almost 70% of the world's population, with no therapeutic currently available. The severe, potentially lethal forms of DENV disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome) are associated with the production of high level of cytokines, elicited as part of the host antiviral response, although the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We previously showed that infection by DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) disrupts promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene product nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) after viral protein translation in infected cells. Apart from playing a key role as the nucleating agent in forming PML-NBs, PML has antiviral activity against various viruses, including DENV. The present study builds on this work, showing for the first time that all four DENV serotypes elicit PML-NB breakdown. Importantly, we show for the first time that of the nuclear localizing proteins of DENV, DENV non-structural protein (NS) 5 polymerase alone is sufficient to elicit PML-NB disassembly, in part through complexing with PML isoforms III and IV, but not other PML isoforms or other PML-NB components. The results raise the possibility that PML-NB disruption by nuclear localized NS5 contributes to DENV's suppression of the host antiviral response. <br>	1100	203	7
The Difference of Angiopoietin-2 Levels between Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Patients with Shock and without Shock.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue infection is one of the problems in the national health sector in Indonesia because the incidence and mortality in Indonesia due to dengue infection is still very high. In 2005 Indonesia became the highest contributor to dengue infection in Southeast Asia (53%) with 95.270 people and 1.298 deaths. <br><b>AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study aims to analyse differences in angiopoietin-2 levels in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with and without shock. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study was a consecutive sampling design with the research subject was obtained based on the order of admission to the hospital - the serum Angiopoietin-2 levels using the ELISA method. The statistical test used is the independent t-test. The value of p < 0.05 was said to be statistically significant. <br><b>RESULT:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe result showed that the mean of Angiopoietin-2 levels in DHF patients with shock was higher than in DHF (p < 0.05). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study concluded that there was a difference in the average level of Angiopoietin-2 among DHF patients with shock compared to without shock. <br>	841	682	8
Systematic review of dengue vaccine efficacy.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is an arbovirus that has rapidly spread worldwide, and the incidence of dengue has greatly increased in recent decades. The actual numbers of dengue cases are underreported, and many cases are not classified correctly. Recent estimates indicate that 390 million dengue infections occur per year (95% CI, 284-528 million), of which 96 million (67-136 million) are symptomatic infections of any severity. One of the goals of the World Health Organization is to reduce dengue mortality by 50% by the year 2020. The use of a vaccine can be an important strategy to achieve this goal. Vaccines for dengue are in various stages of development; in Brazil, only one commercial formulation is available (CYD-TDV), which was developed by Sanofi Pasteur. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo evaluate the efficacy of Dengue vaccine, a systematic review with a meta-analysis was conducted using randomized controlled clinical trials published between 2000 and 2017 that were identified in the MEDLINE databases via PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. The selection was performed by two reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeven clinical trials were included, with a total of 36,371 participants (66,511 person-years) between the ages of 2 and 45 years. The meta-analysis using the random-effects model estimated the efficacy of the vaccine at 44%, with a range from 25 to 59% and high heterogeneity (I2 = 80.1%). The serotype-stratified meta-analysis was homogeneous, except for serotype 2, with the heterogeneity of 64.5%. Most of the vaccinated individuals had previous immunity for at least one serotype, which generated safety concerns in individuals without previous immunity. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCompared with other commercially available vaccines, the dengue vaccine showed poor efficacy. <br>	1519	937	12
Breteau index as a promising early warning signal for dengue fever outbreaks in the Colombo District, Sri Lanka.	Despite the efforts in reducing vector densities, outbreaks of dengue fever have become a frequent event in Sri Lanka. As explained by dengue transmission dynamics, vector control activities intensified at peak or near peak outbreak situations would not be successful in controlling the outbreaks. A reliable method of outbreak prediction is always warranted for early preparedness. Relationships between the monthly Breteau indices of the two vector species (Aedes aegypti L. and Ae. albopictus Skuse) and the monthly dengue incidence in a selected high-risk health division (Kaduwela) in the Colombo District, Sri Lanka were determined for three consecutive years, 2009 to 2011. The same procedure was extended for the whole Colombo District from 2013 to 2016. Cross correlation functions were used to determine the relationships with the corresponding lag-periods. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (ROC) were constructed to determine the performance of the Breteau indices as predictors of impending dengue outbreaks and to establish the threshold values. The pronounced performance with >80% areas under ROC curves and >75% sensitivity and >70% specificity of threshold values with defined lag-periods in correlations emphasize the importance of the Breteau index as a promising early warning signal for dengue outbreaks. The results indicate the importance of the carefully planned routine vector larval surveillance in dengue control programs which would make reliable outbreak predictions with a sufficient window period for early preparedness. <br>	1340	230	9
Why should we apply ABM for decision analysis for infectious diseases?-An example for dengue interventions.	For the evaluation of infectious-diseases interventions, the transmissible nature of such diseases plays a central role. Agent-based models (ABM) allow for dynamic transmission modeling but publications are limited. We aim to provide an overview of important characteristics of ABM for decision-analytic modeling of infectious diseases. A case study of dengue epidemics illustrates model characteristics, conceptualization, calibration and model analysis. First, major characteristics of ABM are outlined and discussed based on ISPOR and ISPOR-SMDM Good Practice guidelines. Second, in our case study, we modeled a dengue outbreak in Cebu City (Philippines) to assess the impact interventions to control the relative growth of the mosquito population. Model outcomes include prevalence and incidence of infected persons. The modular ABM simulates persons and mosquitoes over an annual time horizon considering daily time steps. The model was calibrated and validated. ABM is a dynamic, individual-level modeling approach that is capable to reproduce direct and indirect effects of interventions for infectious diseases. The ability to replicate emerging behavior and to include human behavior or the behavior of other agents is a distinguishing modeling characteristic (e.g., compared to Markov models). Modeling behavior may, however, require extensive calibration and validation. The analyzed hypothetical effectiveness of dengue interventions showed that a reduced human-mosquito ratio of 1:2.5 during rainy seasons leads already to a substantial decrease of infected persons. ABM can support decision-analyses for infectious diseases including disease dynamics, emerging behavior, and providing a high level of reusability due to modularity. <br>	1510	253	14
Selection on Aedes aegypti alters Wolbachia-mediated dengue virus blocking and fitness.	The dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses are transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti and pose a substantial threat to global public health. Current vaccines and mosquito control strategies have limited efficacy, so novel interventions are needed1,2. Wolbachia are bacteria that inhabit insect cells and have been found to reduce viral infection-a phenotype that is referred to as viral 'blocking'3. Although not naturally found in A. aegypti4, Wolbachia were stably introduced into this mosquito in 20114,5 and were shown to reduce the transmission potential of dengue, Zika and chikungunya6,7. Subsequent field trials showed Wolbachia's ability to spread through A. aegypti populations and reduce the local incidence of dengue fever8. Despite these successes, the evolutionary stability of viral blocking is unknown. Here, we utilized artificial selection to reveal genetic variation in the mosquito that affects Wolbachia-mediated dengue blocking. We found that mosquitoes exhibiting weaker blocking also have reduced fitness, suggesting the potential for natural selection to maintain blocking. We also identified A. aegypti genes that affect blocking strength, shedding light on a possible mechanism for the trait. These results will inform the use of Wolbachia as biocontrol agents against mosquito-borne viruses and direct further research into measuring and improving their efficacy. <br>	1199	209	13
Combination of Modified NS1 and NS3 as a Novel Vaccine Strategy against Dengue Virus Infection.	Dengue virus (DENV) causes a range of illness, including dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. DENV nonstructural protein (NS) 1 has been considered to be a desirable vaccine candidate for its ability to induce Ab and complement-dependent cytolysis of DENV-infected cells as well as to block the pathogenic effects of NS1. However a potential drawback of NS1 as a vaccine is that anti-DENV NS1 Abs can lead to endothelial cell damage and platelet dysfunction by antigenic cross-reactivity. Therefore, we modified the DENV NS1 by replacing the C-terminal cross-reactive epitopes with the corresponding region of Japanese encephalitis virus NS1 to generate a chimeric DJ NS1 protein. Active immunization with DJ NS1 induced a strong Ab response. To enhance cellular immunity, we further combined DJ NS1 with DENV NS3 to immunize mice and showed activation of Ag-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in addition to Ab responses. We further detected NS3-specific CTL activities as well as CD107a expression of effector cells. Importantly, the protective effects attributed by DJ NS1 and NS3 immunization were demonstrated in a DENV-infected mouse model by reduced viral titers, soluble NS1 levels, mouse tail bleeding time, and vascular leakage at skin injection sites. Collectively, the results from this study reveal the humoral and cellular immune responses and the protective effects conferred by DJ NS1 and NS3 immunization in the mouse model of DENV infection and provide a potential strategy for dengue vaccine design. <br>	1312	249	9
Dengue vascular leak syndrome: insights into potentially new treatment modalities.	Dengue viruses (DENV) are the most common cause of mosquito-borne viral illness in the world, affecting approximately 400 million people annually. Symptomatic illness ranges from a mild, self-limiting febrile illness to one manifested by plasma leakage that can lead to vascular collapse and death. In this issue of the JCI, Rathore et al. report that DENV can cause mast cell degranulation independently of mast cell infection, resulting in the release of the vasoactive mediators chymase and tryptase. The authors showed that recombinant chymase and tryptase increased endothelial permeability in a dose-dependent manner in human microvascular endothelial cells. They went on to evaluate the tryptase inhibitor nafamostat mesylate in a mouse model for severe DENV viremia. Strikingly, the potential therapeutic prevented and reversed the tryptase-induced vascular permeability. As there are currently no licensed drugs for the treatment of dengue, these findings present a possible treatment modality for severe disease. <br>	880	154	8
Recent advances in understanding dengue.	This is a selective review of recent publications on dengue clinical features, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and vaccine development placed in a context of observations made over the past half century. Four dengue viruses (DENVs) are transmitted by urban cycle mosquitoes causing diseases whose nature and severity are influenced by interacting factors such as virus, age, immune status of the host, and human genetic variability. A phenomenon that controls the kinetics of DENV infection, antibody-dependent enhancement, best explains the correlation of the vascular permeability syndrome with second heterotypic DENV infections and infection in the presence of passively acquired antibodies. Based on growing evidence in vivo and in vitro, the tissue-damaging DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is responsible for most of the pathophysiological features of severe dengue. This review considers the contribution of hemophagocytic histiocytosis syndrome to cases of severe dengue, the role of movement of humans in dengue epidemiology, and modeling and planning control programs and describes a country-wide survey for dengue infections in Bangladesh and efforts to learn what controls the clinical outcome of dengue infections. Progress and problems with three tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are reviewed. Several research mysteries remain: why is the risk of severe disease during second heterotypic DENV infection so low, why is the onset of vascular permeability correlated with defervescence, and what are the crucial components of protective immunity? <br>	1346	229	7
Feasibility of case-control and test-negative designs to evaluate dengue vaccine effectiveness in Malaysia.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe world's first dengue vaccine [Dengvaxia; Sanofi Pasteur] was licensed in 2015 and others are in development. Real-world evaluations of dengue vaccines will therefore soon be needed. We assessed feasibility of case control (CC) and test-negative (TN) design studies for dengue vaccine effectiveness by measuring associations between socio-demographic risk factors, and hospitalized dengue outcomes, in Malaysia. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFollowing ethical approval, we conducted hospital-based dengue surveillance for one year in three referral hospitals. Suspected cases aged 9-25 years underwent dengue virological confirmation by RT-PCR and/or NS1 Ag ELISA at a central laboratory. Two age- and geography-matched hospitalized non-dengue case-controls were recruited for a traditional CC study. Suspected cases testing negative were test-negative controls. Socio-demographic, risk factor and routine laboratory data were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between confirmed dengue and risk factors. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe recruited 327 subjects; 155 were suspected of dengue. The planned sample size was not met. 124 (80%) of suspected cases were dengue-confirmed; seven were assessed as severe. Three had missing RT-PCR results; the study recruited 28 test-negative controls. Only 172 matched controls could be recruited; 90 cases were matched with ≥1 controls. Characteristics of cases and controls were mostly similar. By CC design, two variables were significant risk factors for hospitalized dengue: recent household dengue contact (OR: 54, 95% CI: 7.3-397) and recent neighbourhood insecticidal fogging (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3-3.6). In the TN design, no risk factors were identified. In comparison with gold-standard diagnostics, routine tests performed poorly. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe CC design may be more appropriate than the TN design for hospitalized dengue vaccine effectiveness studies. Selection bias in case control selection could be minimized by protocol changes more easily than increasing TN design control numbers, because early-stage dengue diagnosis in endemic countries is highly specific.

Spatial and temporal patterns of dengue incidence in northeastern Thailand 2006-2016.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue, a viral disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, is an important public health concern throughout Thailand. Climate variables are potential predictors of dengue transmission. Associations between climate variables and dengue have usually been performed on large-scale first-level national administrative divisions, i.e. provinces. Here we analyze data on a finer spatial resolution in one province, which is often more relevant for effective disease control design. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of seasonal variations, monthly climate variability, and to identify local clusters of symptomatic disease at the sub-district level based on reported dengue cases. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspData on dengue cases were retrieved from the national communicable disease surveillance system in Thailand. Between 2006 and 2016, 15,167 cases were recorded in 199 sub-districts of Khon Kaen Province, northeastern Thailand. Descriptive analyses included demographic characteristics and temporal patterns of disease and climate variables. The association between monthly disease incidence and climate variations was analyzed at the sub-district level using Bayesian Poisson spatial regression. A hotspot analysis was used to assess the spatial patterns (clustered/dispersed/random) of dengue incidence. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue was predominant in the 5-14 year-old age group (51.1%). However, over time, dengue incidence in the older age groups (> 15 years) gradually increased and was the most affected group in 2013. Dengue outbreaks coincide with the rainy season. In the spatial regression model, maximum temperature was associated with higher incidence. The hotspot analysis showed clustering of cases around the urbanized area of Khon Kaen city and in rural areas in the southwestern portion of the province. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere was an increase in the number of reported dengue cases in older age groups over the study period. Dengue incidence was highly seasonal and positively associated with maximum ambient temperature. However, climatic variables did not explain all the spatial variation of dengue in the province. Further analyses are needed to clarify the detailed effects of urbanization and other potential environmental risk factors. These results provide useful information for ongoing prediction modeling and developing of dengue early warning systems to guide vector control operations. <br>	2038	984	19
Entomological assessment of dengue virus transmission risk in three urban areas of Kenya.	Urbanization is one of the major drivers of dengue epidemics globally. In Kenya, an intriguing pattern of urban dengue virus epidemics has been documented in which recurrent epidemics are reported from the coastal city of Mombasa, whereas no outbreaks occur in the two major inland cities of Kisumu and Nairobi. In an attempt to understand the entomological risk factors underlying the observed urban dengue epidemic pattern in Kenya, we evaluated vector density, human feeding patterns, vector genetics, and prevailing environmental temperature to establish how these may interact with one another to shape the disease transmission pattern. We determined that (i) Nairobi and Kisumu had lower vector density and human blood indices, respectively, than Mombasa, (ii) vector competence for dengue-2 virus was comparable among Ae. aegypti populations from the three cities, with no discernible association between susceptibility and vector cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene variation, and (iii) vector competence was temperature-dependent. Our study suggests that lower temperature and Ae. aegypti vector density in Nairobi may be responsible for the absence of dengue outbreaks in the capital city, whereas differences in feeding behavior, but not vector competence, temperature, or vector density, contribute in part to the observed recurrent dengue epidemics in coastal Mombasa compared to Kisumu. <br>	1201	209	7
Flavonoids as efficient scaffolds: Recent trends for malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue.	Endemic in 149 tropical and subtropical countries, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect more than 1 billion people annually with over 500,000 deaths. Among the NTDs, some of the most severe consist of leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. The impact of the combined NTDs closely rivals that of malaria. According to the World Health Organization, 216 million cases of malaria were reported in 2016 with 445,000 deaths. Current treatment options are associated with various limitations including widespread drug resistance, severe adverse effects, lengthy treatment duration, unfavorable toxicity profiles, and complicated drug administration procedures. Flavonoids are a class of compounds that has been the subject of considerable scientific interest. New developments of flavonoids have made promising advances for the potential treatment of malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue, with less toxicity, high efficacy, and improved bioavailability. This review summarizes the current standings of the use of flavonoids to treat malaria and neglected diseases such as leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. Natural and synthetic flavonoids are leading compounds that can be used for developing antiprotozoal and antiviral agents. However, detailed studies on toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action of these compounds are required to confirm the in vitro pharmacological claims of flavonoids for pharmaceutical applications. HIGHLIGHTS: In the current review, we have tried to compile recent discoveries on natural and synthetic flavonoids as well as their implication in the treatment of malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. A total of 373 (220 natural and 153 synthetic) flavonoids have been evaluated for antimalarial, antileishmanial, antichagasic, and antidengue activities. Most of these flavonoids showed promising results against the above diseases. Reports on molecular modeling of flavonoid compounds to the disease target indicated encouraging results. Flavonoids can be prospected as potential leads for drug development; however, more rigorously designed studies on toxicity and pharmacokinetics, as well as the quantitative structure-activity relationship studies of these compounds, need to be addressed. <br>	1965	318	15
Assays with recombinant soluble isoforms of DC-SIGN, a dengue virus ligand, show variation in their ability to bind to mannose residues.	The DC-SIGN glycoprotein is responsible for the initial adhesion of dengue virus (DENV) to immune cells by the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). There are thirteen soluble and membrane-bound DC-SIGN isoforms, but the role of soluble isoforms in the DENV internalization process is not known. Five isoforms with an altered or absent CRD were identified, and three different soluble isoforms were used to confirm the interactions with mannose residues. The results show the loss of binding ability of one soluble isoform and binding ability of two of them. All of them will be used to verify their role in the DENV internalization process. <br>	546	107	5
Evaluation of commercially available three dengue rapid diagnostic test kits for diagnosis of acute dengue virus infection at the point-of-care setting in Myanmar.	Early and accurate diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV) infection is very important and Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) Kits are been used as a point-of-care test to check DENV infection. A Hospital and Laboratory-based descriptive study was conducted at 550-bedded Mandalay Children Hospital in 2018. Acute-phase serum samples were collected from 202 dengue suspected patients to evaluate the efficacy of RDT Kits for the diagnosis of DENV infection. Commercially available three test kits which include: ((i) CareUs Dengue Combo, Korea, (ii) Humasis Dengue Combo, Korea and (iii) Wondfo Dengue Combo, China) were validated against WHO-based reference standard tests. 140/202 patients (69.3%) was confirmed to have DENV infection. All four serotypes of dengue viruses (57 DENV-1, 7 DENV-2, 6 DENV-3 and 10 DENV-4) were identified from 80 dengue confirmed patients and DENV-1 was the dominant serotype. Combining the NS-1 antigen and IgM antibody results from the CareUs Dengue Combo Kit gave the best sensitivity (92.1%, 95% CI 86.4%-96.0%) and specificity (75.8%, 95%CI 63.3%-85.8%). Among the three RDT Kits, the performance of CareUS Kit was better than the other two. This study explored the evidence of the usefulness of RDT Kits at the point-of-care setting for diagnosis of acute dengue infection. <br>	1105	225	8
Epidemiology of Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika Virus Disease in the U.S. States and Territories, 2017.	Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, primarily transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes, have caused large outbreaks in the Americas, leading to travel-associated cases and local mosquito-borne transmission in the United States. We describe the epidemiology of dengue, chikungunya, and noncongenital Zika virus disease cases reported from U.S. states and territories in 2017, including 971 dengue cases, 195 chikungunya cases, and 1,118 Zika virus disease cases. Cases of all three diseases reported from the territories were reported as resulting from local mosquito-borne transmission. Cases reported from the states were primarily among travelers, with only seven locally acquired mosquito-transmitted Zika virus disease cases reported from Texas (n = 5) and Florida (n = 2). In the territories, most dengue cases (n = 508, 98%) were reported from American Samoa, whereas the majority of chikungunya (n = 39, 100%) and Zika virus disease (n = 620, 93%) cases were reported from Puerto Rico. Temporally, the highest number of Zika virus disease cases occurred at the beginning of the year, followed by a sharp decline, mirroring decreasing case numbers across the Americas following large outbreaks in 2015 and 2016. Dengue and chikungunya cases followed a more seasonal pattern, with higher case numbers from July through September. Travelers to the United States and residents of areas with active virus transmission should be informed of both the ongoing risk from dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus disease and personal protective measures to lower their risk of mosquito bites and to help prevent the spread of these diseases. <br>	1392	252	7
Dengue: Uncommon Neurological Presentations of a Common Tropical Illness.	Dengue is a common arthropod-borne flavivirus and commonly manifests as fever, bleeding diathesis, and capillary leak syndrome. Neurological manifestations are uncommon except for encephalopathy. We have recently had the opportunity of observing two patients with rare neurological complications of dengue, transverse myelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Both the cases had good neurological recovery with steroid and intravenous immunoglobulin, respectively. How to cite this article: Singh H, Pannu AK, Bhalla A, Suri V, Kumari S.

Clinical Profile and Outcome of Dengue Fever in Multidisciplinary Intensive Care Unit of a Tertiary Level Hospital in India.	<b>Background:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIndia is one of the seven identified countries in South-East Asia region regularly reporting dengue fever (DF)/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) outbreaks. Even though the dengue prodrome and evolution of illness are most often similar in many patients, progress and outcome may differ significantly depending on the severity of illness as well as treatment instituted. We studied the clinical manifestations, outcome and factors predicting mortality of serology confirmed dengue fever cases admitted in Multidisciplinary Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of a high acuity healthcare facility in India. <br><b>Methodology:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll patients with serology proven dengue fever admitted to MICU between 1st July 2015 and1st December 2015 were included in the study. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, severity of illness scores and outcome were recorded. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMajority of the patients (58.4%) belonged to 21-40 year age group. Hepatic (96.8%) followed by hematological (79.2%) involvement were the most common findings. CNS involvement observed among 27%. Survival to hospital discharge was 78.9%. Respiratory and gastrointestinal system involvement was associated with increased mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI) and shock were the clinical syndromes associated with mortality. Serum lactate, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were significantly elevated among non survivors. Significant difference in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) scores was also observed among survivors and non survivors. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOrgan system involvement and higher disease severity scores are strong predictors of mortality. High index of suspicion for atypical manifestations of dengue is warranted. <br><b>How to cite this article:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPadyana M, Karanth S, Vaidya S, Gopaldas JA.

Molecular Epidemiology of Dengue in Panama: 25 Years of Circulation.	Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arbovirus in terms of human public health importance globally. In addition to DENV epidemiological surveillance, genomic surveillance may help investigators understand the epidemiological dynamics, geographic distribution, and temporal patterns of DENV circulation. Herein, we aimed to reconstruct the molecular epidemiology and phylogeny of DENV in Panama to connect the epidemiological history of DENV dispersal and circulation in Latin America. We retrospectively analyzed the epidemiological data obtained during 25 years of DENV surveillance in Panama. DENV was reintroduced in Panama in 1993 after a 35 year absence of autochthonous transmission. The increase in the number of total dengue cases has been accompanied by an increase in severe and fatal cases, with the highest case fatality rate recorded in 2011. All four serotypes were detected in Panama, which is characterized by serotype replacement and/or co-circulation of multiple serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of datasets collected from envelope (E) gene sequences obtained from viruses isolated from human sera demonstrated that circulating viruses were highly diverse and clustered in distinct clades, with co-circulation of clades from the same genotype. Our analyses also suggest that Panamanian strains were related to viruses from different regions of the Americas, suggesting a continuous exchange of viruses within the Americas. <br>	1245	211	8
Epidemiological profile of Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya virus infections identified by medical and molecular evaluations in Rondonia, Brazil.	Several arboviruses have emerged and/or re-emerged in North, Central and South-American countries. Viruses from some regions of Africa and Asia, such as the Zika and Chikungunya virus have been introduced in new continents causing major public health problems. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RNA from Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in symptomatic patients from Rondonia, where the epidemiological profile is still little known, by one-step real-time RT-PCR. The main clinical signs and symtoms were fever (51.2%), headache (78%), chills (6.1%), pruritus (12.2%), exanthema (20.1%), arthralgia (35.3%), myalgia (26.8%) and retro-orbital pain (19.5%). Serum from 164 symptomatic patients were collected and tested for RNA of Zika, Dengue types 1 to 4 and Chikungunya viruses, in addition to antibodies against Dengue NS1 antigen. Direct microscopy for Malaria was also performed. Only ZIKV RNA was detected in 4.3% of the patients, and in the remaining 95.7% of the patients RNA for Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses were not detected. This finding is intriguing as the region has been endemic for Dengue for a long time and more recently for Chikungunya virus as well. The results indicated that medical and molecular parameters obtained were suitable to describe the first report of symptomatic Zika infections in this region. Furthermore, the low rate of detection, compared to clinical signs and symptoms as the solely diagnosis criteria, suggests that molecular assays for detection of viruses or other pathogens that cause similar symptoms should be used and the corresponding diseases could be included in the compulsory notification list. <br>	1429	274	10
Serostatus testing and dengue vaccine cost-benefit thresholds.	The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends pre-screening for past infection prior to administration of the only licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV. Using a threshold modelling analysis, we identify settings where this guidance prohibits positive net-benefits, and are thus unfavourable. Generally, however, our model shows test-then-vaccinate strategies can improve CYD-TDV economic viability: effective testing reduces unnecessary vaccination costs while increasing health benefits. With sufficiently low testing cost, those trends outweigh additional screening costs, expanding the range of settings with positive net-benefits. This work highlights two aspects for further analysis of test-then-vaccinate strategies. We found that starting routine testing at younger ages could increase benefits; if real tests are shown to sufficiently address safety concerns, the manufacturer, regulators and WHO should revisit guidance restricting use to 9-years-and-older recipients. We also found that repeat testing could improve return-on-investment (ROI), despite increasing intervention costs. Thus, more detailed analyses should address questions on repeat testing and testing periodicity, in addition to real test sensitivity and specificity. Our results follow from a mathematical model relating ROI to epidemiology, intervention strategy, and costs for testing, vaccination and dengue infections. We applied this model to a range of strategies, costs and epidemiological settings pertinent to CYD-TDV. However, general trends may not apply locally, so we provide our model and analyses as an R package available via CRAN, denvax. To apply to their setting, decision-makers need only local estimates of age-specific seroprevalence and costs for secondary infections. <br>	1544	257	12

Assessment of the new World Health Organization's dengue classification for predicting severity of illness and level of healthcare required.	The objective of this study was to assess the validity of the new dengue classification proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009 and to develop pragmatic guidelines for case triage and management. This retrospective study involved 357 laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue infection diagnosed at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia over a 4-year period from 2014 to 2017. The sensitivity of the new classification for identifying severe cases was limited (65%) but higher than the old one (30%). It had a higher sensitivity for identifying patients who needed advanced healthcare compared to the old one (72% versus 32%, respectively). We propose adding decompensation of chronic diseases and thrombocytopenia-related bleeding to the category of severe dengue in the new classification. This modification improves sensitivity from 72% to 98% for identifying patients who need advanced healthcare without altering specificity (97%). It also improves sensitivity in predicting severe outcomes from 32% to 88%. In conclusion, the new classification had a low sensitivity for identifying patients needing advanced care and for predicting morbidity and mortality. We propose to include decompensation of chronic diseases and thrombocytopenia-related bleeding to the category of severe dengue in the new classification to improve the sensitivity of predicting cases requiring advanced care. <br>	1220	211	8
Micronutrients, immunological parameters, and dengue virus infection in coastal Ecuador: A nested case-control study in an infectious disease surveillance program.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMicronutrients are known to modulate host immunity and there is limited literature on this association in the context of dengue virus infection (DENV). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing a nested case-control design in a surveillance program, we measured anthropometry; nutritional biomarkers including serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, retinol-binding protein (RBP), 25-hydroxy vitamin D, folate, and vitamin B12; and a panel of immune response markers and compared these measures across four illness categories: healthy control, non-febrile DENV, other febrile illness (OFI), and apparent DENV using multivariate polytomous logistic regression models. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAmong 142 participants, serum ferritin (ng/mL) was associated with apparent DENV compared to healthy controls (OR 2.66; CI 1.53, 4.62; p=0.001), and RBP concentrations (µmol/L) were associated with apparent DENV (OR 0.03; CI 0.00, 0.30; p=0.003) and OFI (OR 0.02; CI 0.00, 0.24; p=0.003). In a subset of 71 participants, IL-15 levels (MFI) were positively associated with apparent DENV (OR 1.09; CI 1.03, 1.14; p=0.001) and negatively associated with non-febrile DENV (OR 0.89; CI 0.80, 0.99; p=0.03) compared to healthy controls. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter adjusting for the acute phase response, serum ferritin and RBP concentrations were associated with apparent DENV and may represent biomarkers of clinical importance in the context of dengue illness. <br>	1181	624	5
A Rare Case of Pituitary Apoplexy Secondary to Dengue Fever-induced Thrombocytopenia.	Pituitary apoplexy (PA) is an endocrine emergency resulting from hemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary tumor or non-tumorous pituitary gland. The most important predisposing factors for PA are cerebral angiographic procedures, systemic hypertension, surgeries, head injury, coagulopathies, and drugs. Thrombocytopenia is a risk factor for PA. Dengue fever causes thrombocytopenia and there are reported cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever predisposing to PA. But there are no reported cases of dengue fever per se predisposing to PA, and we report such a case in an 85-year-old elderly male who presented with features suggestive of a hypertensive emergency and, on evaluation, was found to have a pituitary incidentaloma and dengue fever. During the hospital course, he developed acute IIIrd nerve palsy and, when evaluated, was found to have PA. He responded well to medical management with steroids and thyroxine. Prompt initiation of treatment is of utmost importance in pituitary apoplexy, as it can result in adverse events, including loss of vision and even death from hemodynamic compromise. <br>	944	170	8
Concomitant dengue fever in Varicella zoster infection - A rare presentation.	Varicella zoster infection is one of the self-limiting viral infections during childhood and dengue fever is an endemic infection in Malaysia, which commonly occurs in the form of nonspecific febrile illness at the initial stage. It is rare for the two viral infections to occur simultaneously. A case of dengue fever without warning sign in a five-year old girl was reported, with early symptoms of fever and vesicular rashes. She was clinically diagnosed with varicella zoster infection during the first visit. Surprisingly, she remained febrile even on day six of illness despite no new vesicular lesions on her skin. Due to suspicion of another infection, follow-up investigation was done and revealed isolated thrombocytopenia. This finding was confirmed with positive NS1Ag. A case of rare dengue fever concomitant with varicella zoster infection was reported. <br>	739	138	8
Molecular studies on dengue viruses detected in patients from Central India.	<b>Purpose:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue viruses (DENVs), the causative agents of dengue (DEN), are classified into four serotypes and several genotypes. Identifying circulating serotypes and genotypes has clinical and epidemiological importance; however, limited information in this regard is available from Central India. This laboratory-based study was done to fill this lacuna. <br><b>Materials and Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe samples collected in the acute phase of illness were subjected to DEN NS1 ELISA, and NS1-positive samples (n = 80) were subjected to serotyping; representative samples from each serotype were sequenced to identify genotypes. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeventy-one (88.75%) samples could be serotyped. All the four DENV serotypes with dominance of DENV-3 (n = 33; 47%) were detected. DENV-4 was detected after a gap of 3 years. Cases with multiple DENV serotype infection were identified. Genotyping showed that DENV-1 belonging to genotype III, DENV-2 cosmopolitan (IV), DENV-3 genotype III lineage C and DENV-4 genotype I were in circulation in the year 2016. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur study documents the molecular characteristics of DENV circulating in the area. Detection of heterologous DENV serotype with dominance of DENV-3 emphasises the need for regular molecular monitoring. <br>	1017	560	10
Severe dengue in travellers: pathogenesis, risk and clinical management.	Rationale for review: Dengue is a frequent cause of febrile illness among travellers and has overtaken malaria as the leading cause of febrile illness for those traveling to South East Asia. The purpose is to review the risk of dengue and severe dengue in travellers with a particular focus on the pathogenesis and clinical management of severe dengue. Risk, pathogenesis and clinical management: The risk of travel-acquired dengue depends on destination, season and duration of travel and activities during travel. Seroconversion rates reported in travellers therefore vary between less than 1% to more than 20%. The most common life-threatening clinical response to dengue infection is the dengue vascular permeability syndrome, epidemiologically linked to secondary infection, but can also occur in primary infection. Tertiary and quaternary infections are usually associated with mild or no disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement, viral factors, age, host factors, and clinical experience of the managing physician modulate the risk of progressing to severe dengue. The relative risk of severe dengue in secondary versus primary infection ranges from 2 to 7. The absolute risk of severe dengue in highly endemic areas in children is about 0.1% per year for primary infections, and 0.4% for secondary infections. About 2-4% of secondary infections lead to severe dengue. Severe dengue and death are both relatively rare in general travellers, but more frequently in those visiting friends and relatives (VFR). Clinical management of severe dengue depends on judicious use of fluid rehydration. Conclusions: Although dengue is a frequent cause of travel illness, severe dengue and deaths are rare. Nevertheless, dengue infections can interrupt travel, lead to evacuation and major out-of-pocket costs. Dengue is more frequent than many other travel-related vaccine preventable diseases such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, indicating a need for a dengue vaccine for travellers. <br>	1732	311	15
Dengue with Hemorrhagic Manifestations and Acute Pancreatitis: Case Report and Review.	Dengue fever is an acute viral disease transmitted by arthropods, which has become a major public health problem, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. We found 17 reported cases of dengue complicated with pancreatitis in the world literature, 13 cases were found in Asia, one in Europe, and two in Latin America. This is the first and an unusual case of dengue with hemorrhagic manifestations complicated with acute pancreatitis in Panama. A 37-year-old woman with an unknown past medical history presented to Santo Tomas Hospital (Panama City, Panama) with sudden abdominal pain in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium, described as a burning-like pain radiating towards the back. Five days before the admission, the patient had fever, chills, headache, retro-orbital pain, dizziness, arthralgia, loss of appetite, and fatigue. In the emergency room, a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made and the patient was hospitalized. Physical examination showed bleeding gums, and laboratory tests show leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which suggested an infection caused by the dengue virus. The dengue infection was confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The patient received supportive treatment and the symptoms resolved. She was discharged on the ninth day of hospitalization without any sequela. The final diagnosis was hemorrhagic dengue complicated by acute pancreatitis. <br>	1250	218	11

Small molecule grp94 inhibitors block dengue and Zika virus replication.	Two major flaviviruses, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), cause severe health and economic burdens worldwide. Recently, genome-wide screenings have uncovered the importance of regulators of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway for flavivirus replication in host cells. Here we report the identification of the compound Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-me) as a potent inhibitor of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase-mediated ERAD, which possesses a broad-spectrum activity against both DENV and ZIKV. Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) suggested that CDDO-me binds to grp94, a key component of the Hrd1 pathway, at a low nanomolar concentration, whereas interaction was not detected with its paralog Hsp90. CDDO-me and the grp94 inhibitor PU-WS13 substantially suppressed DENV2 replication and the cytopathic effects caused by DENV and ZIKV infection. The antiviral activities of both compounds were demonstrated for all four DENV serotypes and four ZIKV strains in multiple human cell lines. This study defines grp94 as a crucial host factor for flavivirus replication and identified CDDO-me as a potent small molecule inhibitor of flavivirus infection. Inhibition of grp94 may contribute to the antiviral activity of CDDO-me. Further investigation of grp94 inhibitors may lead to a new class of broad-spectrum anti-flaviviral medications. <br>	1205	213	8
Antiviral activity of ST081006 against the dengue virus.	Dengue virus, the causative agent for the dengue fever, infects approximately 50-100 million people worldwide per year. The high incidence of dengue fever, along with its potential to develop into a severe, life-threatening form, resulted in great interest in the discovery of an antiviral against it. In this study, we constructed a DENV2-EGFP infectious clone, established a fluorescence-based, high-throughput screening platform, and conducted a screen for anti-DENV compounds on a flavonoid-derivative library, Amongst the hits identified, ST081006 was found to be a strong inhibitor of the DENV replication. Time-course studies suggest that the presence of ST081006 is necessary to inhibit successive rounds of virus replication. Further investigations demonstrated that ST081006 affects the synthesis of both viral protein and viral RNA, and one anti-DENV mechanism is the direct inhibition of viral protein synthesis. The replication of all dengue serotypes, along with that of the enterovirus EV-A71, was shown to be affected by ST081006. Attempts to generate ST081006-resistant DENV were unsuccessful, and thus hints at host factors as potential drug target. Together, these results suggest that ST081006 affect DENV replication, likely by acting on a target involved in the viral protein and/or RNA synthesis pathway. <br>	1140	207	7
Assessing the Diversity and Stability of Cellular Immunity Generated in Response to the Candidate Live-Attenuated Dengue Virus Vaccine TAK-003.	The development of an efficacious DENV vaccine has been a long-standing public health priority. However, this effort has been complicated significantly due to the hazard presented by incomplete humoral immunity in mediating immune enhancement of infection and disease severity. Therefore, there is a significant need for DENV vaccine platforms capable of generating broad immune responses including durable cellular immunity, as well as novel analytical tools to assess the magnitude, diversity, and persistence of vaccine-elicited immunity. In this study, we demonstrate that a single dose of the recombinant, tetravalent, live-attenuated DENV vaccine TAK-003 elicits potent and durable cellular immunity against both the structural and non-structural proteins of all four DENV serotypes, which is maintained for at least 4 months post-immunization. Although not contained within the vaccine formulation, significant reactivity against the non-structural (NS) proteins of DENV-1,-3, and-4 is observed following vaccination, to an extent directly proportional to the magnitude of responses to the corresponding vaccine (DENV-2) components. Distinct, quantifiable, and durable patterns of DENV antigen reactivity can be observed in individuals following vaccination. Detailed epitope mapping of T cell reactivity against the DENV-2 proteome using a matrix of overlapping peptide pools demonstrated that TAK-003 elicits a broad response directed across the DENV-2 proteome, with focused reactivity against NS1 and NS3. We conclude that, as measured by an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay, a single dose of TAK-003 generates potent T cell-mediated immunity which is durable in magnitude and breadth through 4 months post-vaccination. <br>	1483	260	8
Evaluation of novel rapid detection kits for dengue virus NS1 antigen in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2017.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the biggest challenges for human health in the world. In addition, a secondary DENV infection sometimes causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which frequently leads to death. For this reason, accurate diagnosis record management is useful for prediction of DHF. Therefore, the demand for DENV rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) is increasing because these tests are easy and rapid to use. However, commercially available RDTs often show low sensitivity for DENV and cross-reactivity against other flaviviruses, especially Zika virus (ZIKV). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe developed two types of novel DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) detection RDTs, designated TKK-1st and TKK-2nd kits. Specificities of the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used in these kits were confirmed by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), dot blot, and western blot using recombinant NS1 proteins and synthetic peptides. For evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the novel DENV NS1 RDTs, we first used cultured DENV and other flaviviruses, ZIKV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). We then used clinical specimens obtained in Bangladesh in 2017 for further evaluation of kit sensitivity and specificity in comparison with commercially available RDTs. In addition, RNA extracted from sera were used for viral genome sequencing and genotyping. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEpitopes of three out of four MAbs used in the two novel RDTs were located in amino acid positions 100 to 122 in the NS1 protein, a region that shows low levels of homology with other flaviviruses. Our new kits showed high levels of sensitivity against various serotypes and genotypes of DENV and exhibited high levels of specificity without cross-reactivity against ZIKV and JEV. In clinical specimens, our RDTs showed sensitivities of 96.0% (145/151, TKK-1st kit) and 96.7% (146/151, TKK-2nd kit), and specificities of 98.0% (98/100, TKK-1st kit and TKK-2nd kit). On the other hand, in the case of the commercially available SD Bioline RDT, sensitivity was 83.4% (126/151) and specificity was 99.0% (99/100) against the same clinical specimens. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur novel DENV NS1-targeting RDTs demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and lacked cross-reactivity against ZIKV and JEV compared with commercially available RDTs. <br>	1938	1074	15
Unusual clinical manifestations of dengue disease - Real or imagined?	The disease caused by each of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) have plagued humans since last century. Symptoms of dengue virus (DENV) infection range from asymptomatic to dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue disease (SDD). One third of the world's population lives in regions with active urban DENV transmission, and thousands of serologically naïve travelers visit these areas annually, making a significant portion of the human population at risk of being infected. Even though lifelong immunity to the homotypic serotype is achieved after a primary DENV infection. Heterotypic DENV infections may be exacerbated by a pre-existing immune memory to the primary infection and can result in an increased probability of severe disease. Not only, age, comorbidities and presence of antibodies transferred passively from dengue-immune mother to infants are considered risk factors to dengue severe forms. Plasma leakage and multiple organ impairment are well documented in the literature, affecting liver, lung, brain, muscle, and kidney. However, unusual manifestation, severe or not, have been reported and may require medical attention. This review will summarize and discuss the increasing reports of unusual manifestations in the clinical course of dengue infection. <br>	1092	194	9
Phylogenetic analysis revealed the co-circulation of four dengue virus serotypes in Southern Thailand.	Dengue fever is caused by dengue viruses (DENV) from the Flavivirus genus and is the most prevalent arboviral disease. DENV exists in four immunogenically distinct and genetically-related serotypes (DENV-1 to 4), each subdivided in genotypes. Despite the endemicity of all four DENV serotypes in Thailand, no prior study has characterized the circulation of DENV in the southern provinces of the country. To determine the genetic diversity of DENV circulating in Southern Thailand in 2015 and 2016, we investigated 46 viruses from 182 patients' sera confirmed positive for DENV by serological and Nested RT-PCR tests. Our dataset included 2 DENV-1, 20 DENV-2, 9 DENV-3 and 15 DENV-4. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on viral envelop sequences. This revealed that part of the identified genotypes from DENV-1 and DENV-4 had been predominant in Asia (genotype I for both serotypes), while genotype II for DENV-4 and the Cosmopolitan genotype DENV-2 were also circulating. Whereas DENV-3 genotype II had been predominantly detected in South East Asia during the previous decades, we found genotype III and genotype I in Southern Thailand. All DENV genotype identified in this study were closely related to contemporary strains circulating in Southeast Asian countries, emphasizing the regional circulation of DENV. These results provide new insights into the co-circulation of all four DENV serotypes in Southern Thailand, confirming the hyperendemicity of DENV in the region. These findings also suggest a new trend of dissemination for some DENV serotypes with a possible shift in genotype distribution; as recently observed in other Asian countries. <br>	1409	265	11
Incidence dynamics and investigation of key interventions in a dengue outbreak in Ningbo City, China.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe reported incidence of dengue fever increased dramatically in recent years in China. This study aimed to investigate and to assess the effectiveness of intervention implemented in a dengue outbreak in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspData of a dengue outbreak were collected in Ningbo City in China by a field epidemiological survey according to a strict protocol and case definition. Serum specimens of all cases were collected for diagnosis and the virological characteristics were detected by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequencing. Vector surveillance was implemented during the outbreak to collect the larva and adult mosquito densities to calculate the Breteau Index (BI) and human biting rate (HBR), respectively. Data of monthly BI and light-trap density in 2018 were built to calculate the seasonality of the vector. A transmission mathematical model was developed to dynamic the incidence of the disease. The parameters of the model were estimated by the data of the outbreak and vector surveillance data in 2018. The effectiveness of the interventions implemented during the outbreak was assessed by the data and the modelling. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom 11 August to 8 September, 2018, a dengue outbreak was reported with 27 confirmed cases in a population of 5536-people community (community A) of Ningbo City. Whole E gene sequences were obtained from 24 cases and were confirmed as dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1). The transmission source of the outbreak was origin from community B where a dengue case having the same E gene sequence was onset on 30 July. Aedes albopictus was the only vector species in the area. The value of BI and HBR was 57.5 and 12 per person per hour respectively on 18 August, 2018 and decreased dramatically after interventions. The transmission model fitted well (χ2 = 6.324, P = 0.388) with the reported cases data. With no intervention, the total simulated number of the cases would be 1728 with a total attack rate (TAR) of 31.21% (95%CI: 29.99%- 32.43%). Case isolation and larva control (LC) have almost the same TAR and duration of outbreak (DO) as no intervention. Different levels of reducing HBR (rHBR) had different effectiveness with TARs ranging from 1.05% to 31.21% and DOs ranging from 27 days to 102 days. Adult vector control (AVC) had a very low TAR and DO. "LC+AVC" had a similar TAR and DO as that of AVC. "rHBR100%+LC", "rHBR100%+AVC", "rHBR100%+LC+AVC" and "rHBR100%+LC+AVC+Iso" had the same effectiveness. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWithout intervention, DENV-1 could be transmitted rapidly within a short period of time and leads to high attack rate in community in China. AVC or rHBR should be recommended as primary interventions to control rapid transmission of the dengue virus at the early stage of an outbreak. <br>	2316	1182	22
[Travel Related Fever and Rash: Two Cases of Dengue Fever].	The frequency of travel-related infections in the world has increased due to the easily and widespread use of travel facilities in the 21st century. Vector-borne diseases are an important part of infectious diseases. Dengue fever is one of the travel-related infections that has been reported increasingly in recent years through the development of diagnostic methods. The aim of this report was to present two Dengue fever cases originating from travel. There was a story of mosquito bite during a trip to Sri Lanka travel in our first case. The patient was 30 years old and maculopapular rash appeared on the fifth day of contact. Three days after the onset of the rash, she has admitted to our clinic, complaining with fever and chills. Increased leukopenia and muscle enzymes were detected in the laboratory analysis. Real-time reverse transcriptase polimerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive in the serum sample. The patient was followed up with supportive care and discharged by improvement. The second case, a 24-year-old male, had a story of mosquito bite during his trip to Malaysia. After the patient complained of fever, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting and muscle pain, the Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen test performed in this country was found to be positive. In the second case, there was no maculopapular rash and laboratory analysis showed an increase in leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and muscle enzymes. RT-PCR positivity was detected in the serum sample. The patient was followed up with supportive treatment and discharged with cure. DENV infections are caused by DENV which is common in the tropical areas of the world. There are four DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 serotypes. DENV infections can present different clinical manifestations such as asymptomatic disease, viral syndrome, Dengue haemorrhagic fever, and Dengue shock syndrome. Dengue fever is often accompanied by arthritis, maculopapular rash and high fever. Our cases were defined as Dengue fever according to this definition. In the diagnosis of the disease, it is necessary first to be suspicious of the disease and the travel history must be questioned. In the definitive diagnosis, virus isolation, antigen, nucleic acid detection and serological tests are used. The virus can be isolated from blood, serum, urine and tissues. In the first five days after beginning of the symptoms associated with DENV infections, serum RT-PCR and Dengue NS1 antigen test may be positive. <br>	2087	402	24
The major oligosaccharyl transferase complex genes are not involved in dengue virus replication in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.	Replication of the dengue virus (DENV) genome occurs in a vesicle in the endoplasmic reticulum by a complex of host and viral proteins. Two host proteins, STT3A and STT3B, as members of the oligosaccharyl transferase complex, have been implicated in playing structural roles in the vesicle in mammalian cells, and the absence of these proteins has been shown to decrease DENV replication. Aedes aegypti is the main vector of the virus and has been used previously as a model organism to study mosquito-virus interactions. In this study, we found that genes of the oligosaccharyl transferase complex have no effect on replication of DENV in mosquito cells. <br>	555	109	4
Dengue Virus M Protein Promotes NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation to Induce Vascular Leakage in Mice.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes serious clinical symptoms, including Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and Dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Vascular permeability change is the main feature of the diseases, and the abnormal expression of pro-inflammation cytokines is the important cause of vascular permeability change. However, the mechanism underlying vascular permeability induced by DENV is not fully elucidated. Here we reveal a distinct mechanism by which DENV infection promotes the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) release to induce endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in mice. DENV M protein interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate the NLRP3 inflammasome assemble and activation, which lead to the induction of pro-inflammation cytokine IL-1β activation and release. Notably, M can induce vascular leakage in mice tissues through activating NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β. More importantly, inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue injuries are induced by M in WT mice tissues, but they are not affected by M in NLRP3 knock-out (NLRP3-/-) mice tissues, and Evans blue intensities in WT mice tissues are significantly higher as compared with NLRP3-/- mice tissues, demonstrating an essential role of NLRP3 in M-induced vascular leakages in mice. Therefore, we propose that upon DENV infection, M interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate the inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion, which lead to induction of endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in mice tissues. The important role of the DENV-M-NLRP3-IL-1β axis in the induction of vascular leakage provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying DENV pathogenesis and DENV-associated DHF and DSS development.IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen and its infection is prevalent in over 100 tropical and sub-tropical countries or regions with approximately 2.5 billion people at risk. DENV infection induces a spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from classical dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying DENV pathogenesis. In this study, the authors reveal that the DENV membrane protein (M) interacts with the host NLRP3 protein to promote the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which leads to the activation and release of pro-inflammation cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). More importantly, the authors demonstrate that M protein can induce vascular permeability and vascular leakage and NLRP3 is required for M-induced vascular leakage in mice tissues. Collectively, this study reveals a distinct mechanism underlying DENV pathogeneses and provides new insights into the development of therapeutic agent for DENV-associated diseases. <br>	2389	419	14
Estimated dengue force of infection and burden of primary infections among Indian children.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspComprehensive, age-stratified dengue surveillance data are unavailable from India and many more dengue cases occur than are reported. Additional information on dengue transmission dynamics can inform understanding of disease endemicity and infection risk. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing age-stratified dengue IgG seroprevalence data from 2556 Indian children aged 5-10 years, we estimated annual force of infection (FOI) at each of 6 sites using a binomial regression model. We estimated the ages by which 50 and 70% of children were first infected; and predicted seroprevalence in children aged 1-10 years assuming constant force-of-infection. Applying these infection rates to national census data, we then calculated the number of primary dengue infections occurring, annually, in Indian children. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnnual force-of-infection at all sites combined was 11.9% (95% CI 8.8-16.2), varying across sites from 3.5% (95% CI 2.8-4.4) to 21.2% (95% CI 18.4-24.5). Overall, 50 and 70% of children were infected by 5.8 (95% CI 4.3-7.9) and 10.1 (95% CI 7.4-13.7) years respectively. In all sites except Kalyani, > 70% of children had been infected before their 11th birthday, and goodness-of-fit statistics indicated a relatively constant force-of-infection over time except at two sites (Wardha and Hyderabad). Nationwide, we estimated 17,013,527 children (95% CI: 14,518,438- 19,218,733), equivalent to 6.5% of children aged < 11 years, experience their first infection annually. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue force-of-infection in India is comparable to other highly endemic countries. Significant variation across sites exists, likely reflecting local epidemiological variation. The number of annual primary infections is indicative of a significant, under-reported burden of secondary infections and symptomatic episodes. <br><b>TRIAL REGISTRATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRegistered retrospectively with clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01477671 ; 18/11/2011) and clinical trials registry of India (ctri.nic.in; CTRI/2011/12/002243 ; 15/12/2011). Date of enrollment of 1st subject: 22/9/2011. <br>	1710	1137	13
Previous dengue or Zika virus exposure can drive to infection enhancement or neutralisation of other flaviviruses.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue virus (DENV) has circulated in Brazil for over 30 years. During this time, one serotype has cyclically replaced the other, until recently, when all four distinct serotypes began to circulate together. Persistent circulation of DENV for long time periods makes sequential infections throughout a person's life possible. After primary DENV infection, life-long immunity is developed for the infecting serotype. Since DENV and Zika virus (ZIKV) are antigenically similar, the possibility of cross-reactions has attracted attention and has been demonstrated in vitro. <br><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of this study was to investigate whether immune-sera from DENV and ZIKV infected patients would cross-react in vitro with other Flaviviridae family members. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCross-reaction of the studied samples with yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Rocio virus (ROCV), Saint Louis virus (SLEV) and Ilheus virus (ILHV) has been investigated by plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) and the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) by flow-cytometry. <br><b>FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAntibodies against ZIKV and DENV virus cross-reacted with other flaviviruses either neutralising or enhancing the infection. Thus, viral entrance into FcRFcɣRII-expressing cells were influenced by the cross-reactive antibodies. ZIKV or DENV immune sera enhanced cellular infection by WNV, ILHV, ROCV and SLEV. Finally, DENV immune sera presented higher neutralising activity for YFV and SLEV. While ZIKV immune sera neutralised WNV, ILHV and ROCV with high frequencies of positivity. <br><b>MAIN CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe co-circulation of those viruses in the same area represents a risk for the development of severe infections if they spread throughout the country. Successive flavivirus infections may have an impact on disease pathogenesis, as well as on the development of safe vaccine strategies. <br>	1545	978	14
Geographical distribution of primary & secondary dengue cases in India - 2017: A cross-sectional multicentric study.	<b>Background & objectives:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue virus infection is endemic in India with all the four serotypes of dengue virus in circulation. This study was aimed to determine the geographic distribution of the primary and secondary dengue cases in India. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted at Department of Health Research / Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR)/(ICMR) viral research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs) and selected ICMR institutes located in India. Only laboratory-confirmed dengue cases with date of onset of illness less than or equal to seven days were included between September and October 2017. Dengue NS1 antigen ELISA and anti-dengue IgM capture ELISA were used to diagnose dengue cases while anti-dengue IgG capture ELISA was used for identifying the secondary dengue cases. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOf the 1372 dengue cases, 897 (65%) were classified as primary dengue and 475 (35%) as secondary dengue cases. However, the proportion varied widely geographically, with Theni, Tamil Nadu; Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh and Udupi-Manipal, Karnataka reporting more than 65 per cent secondary dengue cases while Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir reporting as low as 10 per cent of the same. The median age of primary dengue cases was 25 yr [interquartile range (IQR 17-35] while that of secondary dengue cases was 23 yr (IQR 13.5-34). Secondary dengue was around 50 per cent among the children belonging to the age group 6-10 yr while it ranged between 20-43 per cent among other age groups. <br><b>Interpretation & conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur findings showed a wide geographical variation in the distribution of primary and secondary dengue cases in India. It would prove beneficial to include primary and secondary dengue differentiation protocol in the national dengue surveillance programme. <br>	1455	762	10
Geographical distribution, evaluation of risk of dengue and its relationship with the El Niño Southern Oscillation in an endemic region of Peru between 2004 and 2015.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo determine the geographical distribution and risk stratification of dengue infection in an endemic region of Peru, and its relationship with the presence of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the analysis, the definition and information about the ENSO events in Peru was obtained from the SENAMHI and IGP reports. The geographical distribution of dengue cases in the territory comprising the 11 districts is homogeneous. There were 1 498 confirmed cases of dengue reported, the highest incidence was determined in Puerto Inca where it reached an incidence of 3210.14/100,000 hab. Of the 11 districts, 2 were classified as a high risk of transmission, 3 as moderate risk, 3 as low risk and in 3 of them the risk of virus transmission could not be determined. <br>	643	183	5
A model to study the inhibition of nsP2B-nsP3 protease of dengue virus with imidazole, oxazole, triazole thiadiazole, and thiazolidine based scaffolds.	A theoretical model was developed to allosterically inhibit the biological activity of dengue virus (DENV) by targeting the non-structural protein ns2B-nsP3 protease based on the in silico studies. The imidazole, oxazole, triazole, thiadiazole, and thiazolidine based scaffolds were imported from the ZINC database, reported by various research group with different biological activity. They were found biologically active as they contain heterocyclic fragments. Generic evolutionary based molecular docking was performed to screen the highly potent molecule. The docking results show that the molecule having ZINC ID-633972 is best inhibitor. Further, the bioavailability and other physiochemical parameters were also calculated for the top four molecule. The highly potent molecule was further refined by the density functional theory and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. The MD analysis coroborate the successful docking of the molecule in the binding cavity of nsP2B-nsP3 protease of DENV. The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area approach was also applied and result coroborate the docking and MD result. <br>	974	164	9
Nature of Complex Network of Dengue Epidemic as a Scale-Free Network.	<b>Objectives:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue epidemic is a dynamic and complex phenomenon that has gained considerable attention due to its injurious effects. The focus of this study is to statically analyze the nature of the dengue epidemic network in terms of whether it follows the features of a scale-free network or a random network. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA multifarious network of Aedes aegypti is addressed keeping the viewpoint of a complex system and modelled as a network. The dengue network has been transformed into a one-mode network from a two-mode network by utilizing projection methods. Furthermore, three network features have been analyzed, the power-law, clustering coefficient, and network visualization. In addition, five methods have been applied to calculate the global clustering coefficient. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt has been observed that dengue epidemic follows a power-law, with the value of its exponent γ = -2.1. The value of the clustering coefficient is high for dengue cases, as weight of links. The minimum method showed the highest value among the methods used to calculate the coefficient. Network visualization showed the main areas. Moreover, the dengue situation did not remain the same throughout the observed period. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe results showed that the network topology exhibits the features of a scale-free network instead of a random network. Focal hubs are highlighted and the critical period is found. Outcomes are important for the researchers, health officials, and policy makers who deal with arbovirus epidemic diseases. Zika virus and Chikungunya virus can also be modelled and analyzed in this manner. <br>	1325	691	14
Diagnosis of severe dengue: Challenges, needs and opportunities.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDelayed diagnosis of dengue cases with increased risk for severe disease could lead to poor disease outcome. To date there is no specific laboratory diagnostic test for severe dengue. This qualitative study explored expert views regarding current issues in diagnosing severe dengue, rationale for severe dengue-specific diagnostics, future prospects and features of potential diagnostics for severe dengue. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn-depth individual interviews with thematic saturation were conducted between May and July 2018. The data was analyzed using thematic analysis. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBased on expert opinion, diagnosis of severe dengue is challenging as it depends on astute clinical interpretation of non-dengue-specific clinical and laboratory findings. A specific test that detects impending manifestation of severe dengue could 1) overcome failure in identifying severe disease for referral or admission, 2) facilitate timely and appropriate management of plasma leakage and bleeding, 3) overcome the lack of clinical expertise and laboratory diagnosis in rural health settings. The most important feature of any diagnostics for severe dengue is the point-of-care (POC) format where it can be performed at or near the bedside. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe development of diagnostics to detect impending severe dengue is warranted to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates of dengue infection and it should be prioritized. <br>	1177	603	8
Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Substituted 4,6-Dihydrospiro[[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-b]pyridine-7,3'-indoline]-2',5(3H)-dione Analogues as Potent NS4B Inhibitors for the Treatment of Dengue Virus Infection.	A series of substituted 4,6-dihydrospiro[[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-b]pyridine-7,3'-indoline]-2',5(3H)-dione analogues were synthesized and evaluated as potent dengue virus inhibitors. Throughout a structure-activity relationship exploration on the amide of the indolone moiety, a wide range of substitutions were found to be well tolerated for chemical optimization at this position. Among these compounds, 15 (JMX0254) displayed the most potent and broad inhibitory activities, effective against DENV-1 to -3 with EC50 values of 0.78, 0.16, and 0.035 μM, respectively, while compounds 16, 21, 27-29, 47, and 70 exhibited relatively moderate to high activities with low micromolar to nanomolar potency against all four serotypes. The biotinylated compound 73 enriched NS4B protein from cell lysates in pull-down studies, and the findings together with the mutation investigations further validated dengue NS4B protein as the target of this class of compounds. More importantly, compound 15 exhibited good in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and efficacy in the A129 mouse model, indicating its therapeutic potential against the dengue virus infection as a drug candidate for further preclinical development. <br>	1042	190	5
Clinical relevance of Zika symptoms in the context of a Zika Dengue epidemic.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe clinical characteristics of the most frequent arbovirosis (Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya) are very similar, which is a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. <br><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo identify the presence of clinical characteristics related to Zika virus infection confirmed by the laboratory in patients during an epidemic of co-infection with Zika and Dengue viruses. <br><b>METHOD:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCross-sectional descriptive study of patients with clinical - epidemiological suspicion of Zika virus infection, who were admitted in the Hospital "Joaquín Albarrán" (La Habana, Cuba), during June 1 to October 31 of 2017. Demographic and symptoms and signs were recorded. By PCR for Zika virus (in blood or urine) the disease was confirmed. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1541 patients were studied. The most frequent symptoms and signs were rash (93.8%), pruritus (77.9%), arthralgia (60.0%), headache (50.8%), myalgia (46.1%), fever (34.7%), asthenia (31.7%), and conjunctivitis (27.9%). Zika virus infection was confirmed in 279 patients (18.1%). Greater frequency of arthralgia, asthenia, and diarrhea was demonstrated in Zika confirmed patients. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMinor clinical relevance was observed in the symptoms or signs of arboviral disease to support the clinical diagnosis of Zika virus infections by clinician during a Zika-Dengue epidemic. The assessment of the temporality of the onset of Zika and Dengue symptoms of these infections is recommended to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis. <br>	1215	677	10
Structural and Functional Properties of the Capsid Protein of Dengue and Related Flavivirus.	Dengue, West Nile and Zika, closely related viruses of the Flaviviridae family, are an increasing global threat, due to the expansion of their mosquito vectors. They present a very similar viral particle with an outer lipid bilayer containing two viral proteins and, within it, the nucleocapsid core. This core is composed by the viral RNA complexed with multiple copies of the capsid protein, a crucial structural protein that mediates not only viral assembly, but also encapsidation, by interacting with host lipid systems. The capsid is a homodimeric protein that contains a disordered N-terminal region, an intermediate flexible fold section and a very stable conserved fold region. Since a better understanding of its structure can give light into its biological activity, here, first, we compared and analyzed relevant mosquito-borne Flavivirus capsid protein sequences and their predicted structures. Then, we studied the alternative conformations enabled by the N-terminal region. Finally, using dengue virus capsid protein as main model, we correlated the protein size, thermal stability and function with its structure/dynamics features. The findings suggest that the capsid protein interaction with host lipid systems leads to minor allosteric changes that may modulate the specific binding of the protein to the viral RNA. Such mechanism can be targeted in future drug development strategies, namely by using improved versions of pep14-23, a dengue virus capsid protein peptide inhibitor, previously developed by us. Such knowledge can yield promising advances against Zika, dengue and closely related Flavivirus. <br>	1391	247	10
Simultaneous zika and dengue serotype-4 viral detection and isolation from a donor plasma unit.	During zika and dengue viruse (ZIKV and DENV) outbreaks, the majority of the infected individuals remain clinically asymptomatic. Such asymptomatic individuals may occasionally acquire both arboviruses, donate blood, and contaminate haemoderivatives. The aim of this study was to characterize a ZIKV/DENV-4 coinfection in asymptomatic blood donor who donated blood during a large mixed ZIKV/DENV outbreak in the Säo Paulo State, Brazil. On the basis of post-donation information, one blood donor sample was found positive for ZIKV and DENV RNA. The DENV molecular serotyping was performed by molecular testing. The sample was also titrated on VERO E6 cells in order to define the presence of infectious arboviruses. The real-time PCR testing of the blood donor sample demonstrated very high viral load for both ZIKV and DENV. Further, molecular serotyping of DENV showed that the presence of DENV-4. The viral titration in cell culture indicated a titre of 2.75x10[6] PFU/ml which was concordant with the presence of infectious viruses in the blood donation. This is an interesting report for the simultaneous presence of infectious ZIKV and DENV-4 in asymptomatic blood sample. Special attention must be paid during mixed arboviral outbreaks for the possibility of transfusion-transmission of multiple arboviral agents. <br>	1129	210	11
HLA Upregulation During Dengue Virus Infection Suppresses the Natural Killer Cell Response.	Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus in the world and a major cause of morbidity in the tropics and subtropics. Upregulation of HLA class I molecules has long been considered a feature of DENV infection, yet this has not been evaluated in the setting of natural infection. Natural killer (NK) cells, an innate immune cell subset critical for mounting an early response to viral infection, are inhibited by self HLA class I, suggesting that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection could dampen the NK cell response. Here we addressed whether upregulation of HLA class I molecules occurs during in vivo DENV infection and, if so, whether this suppresses the NK cell response. We found that HLA class I expression was indeed upregulated during acute DENV infection across multiple cell lineages in vivo. To better understand the role of HLA class I upregulation, we infected primary human monocytes, a major target of DENV infection, in vitro. Upregulation of total HLA class I is dependent on active viral replication and is mediated in part by cytokines and other soluble factors induced by infection, while upregulation of HLA-E occurs in the presence of replication-incompetent virus. Importantly, blocking DENV-infected monocytes with a pan-HLA class I Fab nearly doubles the frequency of degranulating NK cells, while blocking HLA-E does not significantly improve the NK cell response. These findings demonstrate that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection suppresses the NK cell response, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis. <br>	1347	256	9

Forecasting dengue fever in Brazil: An assessment of climate conditions.	Local climate conditions play a major role in the biology of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the main vector responsible for transmitting dengue, zika, chikungunya and yellow fever in urban centers. For this reason, a detailed assessment of periods in which changes in climate conditions affect the number of human cases may improve the timing of vector-control efforts. In this work, we develop new machine-learning algorithms to analyze climate time series and their connection to the occurrence of dengue epidemic years for seven Brazilian state capitals. Our method explores the impact of two key variables-frequency of precipitation and average temperature-during a wide range of time windows in the annual cycle. Our results indicate that each Brazilian state capital considered has its own climate signatures that correlate with the overall number of human dengue-cases. However, for most of the studied cities, the winter preceding an epidemic year shows a strong predictive power. Understanding such climate contributions to the vector's biology could lead to more accurate prediction models and early warning systems. <br>	960	177	7
Evaluating the effects of control interventions and estimating the inapparent infections for dengue outbreak in Hangzhou, China.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe number of dengue fever (DF) cases and the number of dengue outbreaks have increased in recent years in Zhejiang Province, China. An unexpected dengue outbreak was reported in Hangzhou in 2017 and caused more than one thousand dengue cases. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of the actual control measures, estimate the proportion of inapparent infections during this outbreak and simulate epidemic development based on different levels of control measures taking inapparent infections into consideration. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe epidemic data of dengue cases in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, in 2017 and the number of the people exposed to the outbreaks were obtained from the China Information Network System of Disease Prevention and Control. The epidemic without intervention measures was used to estimate the unknown parameters. A susceptible-exposed-infectious/inapparent-recovered (SEIAR) model was used to estimate the effectiveness of the control interventions. The inapparent infections were also evaluated at the same time. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn total, 1137 indigenous dengue cases were reported in Hangzhou in 2017. The number of indigenous dengue cases was estimated by the SEIAR model. This number was predicted to reach 6090 by the end of November 2, 2017, if no control measures were implemented. The total number of reported cases was reduced by 81.33% in contrast to the estimated incidence without intervention. The number of average daily inapparent cases was 10.18 times higher than the number of symptomatic cases. The earlier and more rigorously the vector control interventions were implemented, the more effective they were. The results showed that implementing vector control continuously for more than twenty days was more effective than every few days of implementation. Case isolation is not sufficient enough for epidemic control and only reduced the incidence by 38.10% in contrast to the estimated incidence without intervention, even if case isolation began seven days after the onset of the first case. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe practical control interventions in the outbreaks that occurred in Hangzhou City were highly effective. The proportion of inapparent infections was large, and it played an important role in transmitting the disease during this epidemic. Early, continuous and high efficacy vector control interventions are necessary to limit the development of a dengue epidemic. Timely diagnosis and case reporting are important in the intervention at an early stage of the epidemic. <br>	2123	1007	18
Use of a Blockade-of-Binding ELISA and Microneutralization Assay to Evaluate Zika Virus Serostatus in Dengue-Endemic Areas.	Zika virus (ZIKV) serological diagnostics are compromised in areas where dengue viruses (DENV) co-circulate because of their high levels of protein sequence homology. Here, we describe the characterization of a Zika blockade-of-binding ELISA (Zika BOB) and a Zika microneutralization assay (Zika MN) for the detection of ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-specific antibodies and ZIKV neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Zika BOB and Zika MN cutoffs were established as 10 and 100 endpoint titers, respectively, using samples collected pre- and post-virologically confirmed ZIKV infection from subjects living in DENV-endemic areas. Specificity of the assays was equally high, whereas sensitivity of Zika BOB was lower than that of Zika MN, especially in samples collected > 6 months post-infection. Immunosurveillance analysis, using combined results from both Zika BOB and Zika MN, carried out also in DENV-endemic regions in Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, and Puerto Rico before (2013-2014) and after (2017-2018) ZIKV introduction in the Americas suggests unapparent ZIKV seroprevalence rates ranged from 25% to 80% over the specified period of time in the regions investigated. <br>	1018	180	5
Epidemiological and Evolutionary Analysis of Dengue-1 Virus Detected in Guangdong during 2014: Recycling of Old and Formation of New Lineages.	The incidence of dengue is increasing in Guangdong, China, with the largest outbreak to date in 2014. Widespread awareness of epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the dengue virus (DENV) is required. In 2014, we isolated the virus from patients and sequenced its genome. The sequences of DENV isolated from Guangdong and other countries screened since 2005 were studied to establish molecular evolutionary databases along with epidemiological data to explore its epidemiological, phylogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Causes underlying the occurrence of the dengue epidemic included importation and localization of the virus. The number of indigenous cases significantly exceeded that of imported cases. Dengue virus 1 is the most important serotype and caused the long-term epidemic locally. Based on the data available since 2005, DENV1 was divided into three genotypes (I, IV, and V). Only genotypes I and V were detected in 2014. In 2014, an epidemic involving old lineages of DENV1 genotype V occurred after 2 years of silence. The genotype was previously detected from 2009 to 2011. Genotype I, which caused recent epidemics, demonstrated a continuation of new lineages, and a predictive pattern of molecular evolution since 2005 among the four lineages was present. The DENV isolated from Guangdong was closely related to those causing large-scale epidemics in neighboring countries, suggesting the possibility of its import from these countries. The lack of sufficient epidemiological data and evidence on the local mosquito-borne DENV emphasizes the importance of studying the molecular evolutionary features and establishing a well-established phylogenetic tree for dengue prevention and control in Guangdong. <br>	1490	260	11
Dengue Myocarditis: An Important Clinical Entity to Consider in Dengue Patient.	We are going to report a case study of dengue fever (DF) affecting myocardium and explore the literature. A gentleman of 28 years old experienced DF which was complicated by acute myocarditis, acute kidney injury and hepatitis in the Emergency Department of Apollo Hospitals, Dhaka, Bangladesh on 5th August 2017. Clinically it was considered as an acute coronary syndrome due to depressed ST segment in chest leads ECG, extreme bradycardia but normal serum troponin-I level. He had to undergo temporary pacemaker insertion for symptomatic bradycardia and later on, he was monitored closely. Fortunately, he recovered; pacemaker was removed on day 8 of his admission without any further complication. After 3 days, patient recovered with symptomatic treatment. In different publications, various manifestations of cardiac complications occurred, from self-limiting tachy-brady arrhythmia to severe damage of the myocardium, causing reduced blood pressure and pulmonary edema. To reduce morbidity and mortality, physicians should suspect for cardiac complications in patients with dengue fever and should manage these complications. <br>	974	168	7
Dengue Virus NS1 Exposure Affects von Willebrand Factor Profile and Platelet Adhesion Properties of Cultured Vascular Endothelial Cells.	Hematological abnormalities and altered vascular permeability are frequently encountered in Dengue virus infected patients, but the mechanisms that alter platelet-endothelium interactions remain incompletely understood. The DENV NS1 protein has been implicated in adverse disease outcomes. In the present study the role of NS1 protein in affecting the expression of vWF and platelet adhesion properties of endothelial cells was studied in vitro. The results suggest that vWF is down regulated in cultured endothelial cells 6 and 24 h after exposure with increase in vWF levels in culture supernatants at corresponding time points. Ultrastructural studies showed distinct evidence of endothelial cell activation morphology and degranulation of Weibel-Palade bodies in NS1 exposed cells that also showed increased platelet activation physiology. The findings suggest that changes in vWF production and secretion may be induced in endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS1 protein; and play a role in bleeding complications of severe DENV disease. <br>	897	153	6
Multiplexed Adaptive RT-PCR Based on L-DNA Hybridization Monitoring for the Detection of Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya RNA.	Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for the molecular diagnosis of many infectious diseases, including RNA viruses, but is generally limited to settings with access to trained personnel and laboratory resources. We have previously reported a fundamentally simpler thermal cycling platform called Adaptive PCR, which dynamically controls thermal cycling conditions during each cycle by optically monitoring the annealing and melting of mirror-image L-DNA surrogates of the PCR primers and targets. In this report, we integrate optically-controlled reverse transcription and single-channel monitoring of L-DNAs to develop a multiplexed Adaptive RT-PCR instrument and assay for the detection of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus RNA with high target specific and low limits of detection. The assay is demonstrated to detect as low as 5 copies/reaction of Zika or chikungunya RNA and 50 copies/reaction of dengue RNA. The multiplexed Adaptive RT-PCR instrument is robust and has many of the features required to implement diagnostic assays for RNA viruses in settings that lack traditional laboratory resources. <br>	992	177	5
Serine protease inhibitor AEBSF reduces dengue virus infection via decreased cholesterol synthesis.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection has evolved into a major global health menace and economic burden due to its intensity and geographic distribution. DENV infection in humans can cause a wide range of symptoms including dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). An antiviral agent that is effective against all four serotypes of DENV is urgently needed to prevent and to manage this condition. Reducing the viral load during the early phase of infection may minimize the chance of patients progressing to more severe DHF or DSS. In this study, we set forth to investigate the anti-viral effect of five commercially available protease inhibitors on DENV infection since both viral and host proteases can contribute to effective viral replication. Previously, the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene sulfonyl fluoride] has been shown to inhibit DENV NS3 protease activity. The results of the present study revealed that DENV genome replication and protein synthesis were significantly inhibited by AEBSF in a dose-dependent manner. AEBSF inhibited the expression of genes such as 3-hydroxy 3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Moreover, AEBSF significantly inhibited HMGCR activity and intracellular cholesterol synthesis after DENV infection. The anti-DENV effect of AEBSF was confirmed in all four DENV serotypes and in three different cell lines. These results indicate that AEBSF reduces DENV infection via both viral and host protease activities. <br>	1382	248	11
Dengue genetic divergence generates within-serotype antigenic variation, but serotypes dominate evolutionary dynamics.	Dengue virus (DENV) exists as four genetically distinct serotypes, each of which is historically assumed to be antigenically uniform. Recent analyses suggest that antigenic heterogeneity may exist within each serotype, but its source, extent and impact remain unclear. Here, we construct a sequence-based model to directly map antigenic change to underlying genetic divergence. We identify 49 specific substitutions and four colinear substitution clusters that robustly predict dengue antigenic relationships. We report moderate antigenic diversity within each serotype, resulting in genotype-specific patterns of heterotypic cross-neutralization. We also quantify the impact of antigenic variation on real-world DENV population dynamics, and find that serotype-level antigenic fitness is a dominant driver of dengue clade turnover. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between dengue genetic and antigenic evolution, and quantify the effect of antigenic fitness on dengue evolutionary dynamics. <br>	897	145	7
Integrated vector management with additional pre-transmission season thermal fogging is associated with a reduction in dengue incidence in Makassar, Indonesia: Results of an 8-year observational study.	Dengue virus transmission is endemic in Makassar, Indonesia, with the majority of cases reported soon after the start of the annual rainy season. Before 2006, larval source reduction, larvaciding, and reactive routine, outdoor, insecticide fogging campaigns did not result in a reduction in seasonal dengue incidence. Beginning in 2006, village volunteers conducted comprehensive surveys for immature Aedes during the dry season, when vector populations were at their lowest. Based on this pre-season vector data, a single additional pre-emptive outdoor fogging with Malathion was conducted once annually before the rains began in villages with a pre-defined proportion of sampled houses positive for Aedes immatures. This additional procedure was associated with reduced temporal larval indices as well as an 83% reduction in reported cases during the transmission season over the 8-year period of implementation. Two cities adjacent to Makassar experienced substantial but smaller reductions in dengue incidence; while other cities further from the intervention area did not. This represents the first time an integrated intervention strategy has been coupled with substantially reduced dengue transmission in Indonesia. <br>	1054	180	7

Dengue infection and advances in dengue vaccines for children.	Dengue viruses are endemic in most tropical and subtropical countries where they produce disease ranging from a mild fever to a severe, potentially fatal vascular permeability syndrome. We reviewed the status of development and testing in children of three vaccines designed to protect against the four dengue viruses. The first dengue virus vaccine, Dengvaxia, now licensed in 20 endemic countries, the EU and the USA, provides protection against severe dengue in seropositive individuals but increases the risk for naive recipients to develop severe dengue and to be hospitalised. We discuss mechanisms and implications of shortcomings of the licensed vaccine and describe the structure and attributes of two other dengue virus vaccines. Based upon human dengue challenge studies, one of these vaccines promises to deliver solid, long-lasting immunity after a single dose. Because dengue virus infections are ubiquitous in residents and visitors to tropical countries, in the absence of a protective vaccine paediatricians should recognise the early signs and clinical presentation of severe dengue, understand its pathophysiology and appropriate management. <br>	997	172	6
Pre-vaccination screening strategies for the use of the CYD-TDV dengue vaccine: A meeting report.	The first licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia) is efficacious in seropositive individuals, but increases the risk for severe dengue in seronegative persons about two years after administration of the first dose. For countries considering the introduction of Dengvaxia, WHO recommends a pre-vaccination screening strategy whereby only persons with evidence of a past dengue infection would be vaccinated. Policy-makers need to consider the risk-benefit of vaccination strategies based on such screening tests, the optimal age to introduce the vaccine, communication and implementation strategies. To address these questions, the Global Dengue and Aedes-transmitted diseases Consortium (GDAC) organized a 3-day workshop in January 2019 with country representatives from Asia and Latin America. The meeting discussions highlighted many challenges in introducing Dengvaxia, in terms of screening test characteristics, costs of such tests combined with a 3-dose schedule, logistics, achieving high coverage rates, vaccine confidence and communication; more challenges than for any other vaccine introduction programme. A screening test would require a high specificity to minimize individual risk, and at the same time high sensitivity to maximize individual and population benefit. The underlying seroprevalence dependent positive predictive value is the best indicator for an acceptable safety profile of a pre-vaccination screening strategy. The working groups discussed many possible implementation strategies. Addressing the bottlenecks in school-based vaccine introduction for Dengvaxia will also benefit other vaccines such as HPV and booster doses for tetanus and pertussis. Levels of public trust are highly variable and context specific, and understanding of population perceptions and concerns is essential to tailor interventions, monitor and mitigate risks. <br>	1624	266	10
Spatio-temporal distribution analysis of circulating genotypes of dengue virus type 1 in western and southern states of India by a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay.	Dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) Asian and American/African (AM/AF) genotypes were reported to be co-circulating in southern and western states of India based on envelope (E) gene sequencing of few representative samples. The objective of the present study was to develop a one-step real-time RT-PCR to discriminate between Asian and AM/AF genotypes of DENV-1 and investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of the DENV-1 genotypes in southern and western states of India. A one-step real-time RT-PCR to discriminate the Asian and AM/AF genotypes of DENV-1 was developed and validated using 40 samples (17 Asian and 23 AM/AF), for which the envelope (E) gene sequence data was available. DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 isolates, one each and DENV negative samples (n = 17) were also tested by the assay. Additional 296 samples positive for DENV-1 from selected Southern and Western states of India were genotyped using the real-time RT-PCR assay. Among the samples used for validation, the genotyping results were concordant with sequencing results for 39 samples. In the one discordant sample which was positive for AM/AF by sequencing, the genotyping assay tested positive for both Asian and AM/AF genotype. DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 isolates were not reactive in the assay. None of the DENV negative samples were positive (sensitivity 100% and specificity 98.2%). A total of 336 samples (40 samples with sequence data and 296 samples without sequence data) were used for spatio-temporal distribution analysis. The results revealed that the Asian genotype was the predominant genotype in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the southern states. The AM/AF genotype was the predominant genotype in Maharashtra, a western state of India. In Nashik district of Maharashtra, Asian genotype was observed in 32.6% of DENV-1 samples during 2017 while the same decreased to 7.3% during 2018. In Pune district, Asian genotype was observed in 40.0% of DENV-1 samples during 2018 only. To conclude, a one step real-time RT-PCR has been developed for discriminating Asian and AM/AF genotypes of DENV-1. This assay can act as a complement to sequencing but not a substitute and can be utilized in resource limited settings for molecular surveillance of DENV-1. DENV-1 Asian genotype was the dominant genotype in South India while, AM/AF genotype was dominant in Western India. <br>	1983	410	16

Dengue Cases in Colombia: Mathematical Forecasts for 2018-2022.	INTRODUCTION Dengue is a disease caused by any one of five virus serotypes and transmitted to humans by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Climate change and health conditions have combined to make dengue a global public health problem. The situation is especially serious in Colombia, where by week 36 of 2018, dengue incidence was 96 cases per 100,000 population, with a total of 111 deaths. Different mathematical and statistical models have been proposed to understand the dynamics of transmission and consequently to apply control strategies to reduce the number of dengue cases. OBJECTIVE Forecast the number of dengue cases expected in Colombia from 2018 through 2022 with the stochastic Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and use the results to adjust the parameters of an ordinary differential equations model in order to determine the disease's basic reproduction number in the year presenting the highest number of dengue cases. METHODS An ecological time series study was conducted to forecast dengue incidence in Colombia from 2018 through 2022. The data were compiled from Colombia's National Health Institute series on dengue cases reported by epidemiological week from 2009 to 2017. The stochastic ARIMA time series model was applied. Forecasts were then analyzed, and the year with the highest number of predicted cases was used to adjust the parameters of an ordinary differential equations model (ODE) through nonlinear least squares regression to calculate the vectorial capacity of the transmitting mosquito. RESULTS Forecasts of the total number of dengue cases per year in Colombia for the following five years were: 32,411 (2018); 88,221 (2019); 56,392 (2020); 47,940 (2021); and 77,344 (2022). The highest number of cases was forecast for 2019. Values for the parameters affecting dengue transmission that year (by the year's four quarters), such as recovery rate (0.0992, 0.0838, 0.1177, and 0.1535, respectively), vectorial capacity of the transmitting mosquito (0.1720, 0.1705, 0.1204, and 0.2147, respectively) and the basic dengue reproduction number (1.73, 2.03, 1.02, and 1.40, respectively) were estimated, indicating that most cases would occur in the second quarter and, since the basic reproduction number values were >1, the disease would persist in the country throughout the entire year. CONCLUSIONS ARIMA model forecasts for 2018 through 2022 predicted the highest incidence of dengue cases in Colombia would occur in 2019. Comparison of ARIMA model forecasts and the ODE model allowed projections of possible variations in dengue cases reported, and the basic reproduction number predicted that dengue would persist throughout 2019.

Diagnostic accuracy and predictive value in differentiating the severity of dengue infection.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo review the diagnostic test accuracy and predictive value of statistical models in differentiating the severity of dengue infection. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspElectronic searches were conducted in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (complete), PubMed and Scopus. Eligible studies to be included in this review were cohort studies with participants confirmed by laboratory test for dengue infection and comparison among the different severity of dengue infection by using statistical models. The methodological quality of the paper was assessed by independent reviewers using QUADAS-2. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwenty-six studies published from 1994 to 2017 were included. Most diagnostic models produced an accuracy of 75% to 80% except one with 86%. Two models predicting severe dengue according to the WHO 2009 classification have 86% accuracy. Both of these logistic regression models were applied during the first three days of illness, and their sensitivity and specificity were 91-100% and 79.3-86%, respectively. Another model which evaluated the 30-day mortality of dengue infection had an accuracy of 98.5%. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough there are several potential predictive or diagnostic models for dengue infection, their limitations could affect their validity. It is recommended that these models be revalidated in other clinical settings and their methods be improved and standardised in future. <br>	1209	572	11
Novel differential linear B-cell epitopes to identify Zika and dengue virus infections in patients.	<b>Objectives:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRecent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks challenged existing laboratory diagnostic standards, especially for serology-based methods. Because of the genetic and structural similarity of ZIKV with other flaviviruses, this results in cross-reactive antibodies, which confounds serological interpretations. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPlasma from Singapore ZIKV patients was screened longitudinally for antibody responses and neutralising capacities against ZIKV. Samples from healthy controls, ZIKV patients and DENV patients were further assessed using ZIKV and DENV peptides of precursor membrane (prM), envelope (E) or non-structural 1 (NS1) viral proteins in a peptide-based ELISA for epitope identification. Identified epitopes were re-validated and diagnostically evaluated using sera of patients with DENV, bacteria or unknown infections from Thailand. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLong-lasting ZIKV-neutralising antibodies were elicited during ZIKV infection. Thirteen potential linear B-cell epitopes were identified, and of these, four common flavivirus, three ZIKV-specific and one DENV-specific differential epitopes had more than 50% sensitivity and specificity. Notably, ZIKV-specific peptide 26 on domain I/II of E protein (amino acid residues 271-288) presented 80% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. Importantly, the differential epitopes also showed significance in differentiating non-flavivirus patient samples. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLinear B-cell epitope candidates to differentiate between ZIKV and DENV infections were identified, providing the first step towards the design of a much-needed serology-based assay. <br>	1355	636	10
Risk prediction for severe disease and better diagnostic accuracy in early dengue infection; the Colombo dengue study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA major challenge in dengue management in resource limited settings is the confirmation of diagnosis. Clinical features of dengue often overlap with other infections and molecular diagnostic tools are not readily accessible to clinicians at hospitals. In addition, the prediction of plasma leakage in dengue is also difficult. Hematocrit level and ultrasound scans (combined with clinical parameters) are helpful to detect plasma leakage once it has happened, not before. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspColombo Dengue Study (CDS) is a prospective cohort study of clinically suspected adult dengue patients recruited from the National hospital of Sri Lanka (within the first 3 days of fever) that aimed to a) identify clinical and basic laboratory test parameters to differentiate dengue from non-dengue fever, b) evaluate the comparative efficacy of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for dengue diagnosis (vs. NS1 antigen test and RT-qPCR) and c) identify early associations that are predictive of plasma leakage or severe dengue. The basic laboratory tests considered here included hematological parameters, serum biochemistry and inflammatory markers. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnly 70% of clinically suspected patients were confirmed as having dengue by either the NS1 antigen test or RT-qPCR. On a Bayesian latent class model which assumes no "gold standard", LAMP performed equally or better than RT-qPCR and NS1 antigen test respectively. When confirmed dengue patients were compared with others, the earlier group had significantly lower lymphocyte counts and higher aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST) within the first 3 days of fever. Confirmed dengue patients with plasma leakage had a lower mean age and a higher median baseline AST level compared to those without plasma leakage (p < 0.05). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClinical suspicion overestimates the true number of dengue patients. RT-LAMP is a potentially useful low-cost diagnostic tool for dengue diagnosis. Confirmed dengue patients had significantly higher AST levels and lower lymphocyte counts in early disease compared to others. In confirmed dengue patients, younger age and a higher AST level in early infection were associated with subsequent plasma leakage. <br>	1854	911	15
Primary infection with dengue or Zika virus does not affect the severity of heterologous secondary infection in macaques.	Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are genetically and antigenically related flaviviruses that now co-circulate in much of the tropical and subtropical world. The rapid emergence of ZIKV in the Americas in 2015 and 2016, and its recent associations with Guillain-Barré syndrome, birth defects, and fetal loss have led to the hypothesis that DENV infection induces cross-reactive antibodies that influence the severity of secondary ZIKV infections. It has also been proposed that pre-existing ZIKV immunity could affect DENV pathogenesis. We examined outcomes of secondary ZIKV infections in three rhesus and fifteen cynomolgus macaques, as well as secondary DENV-2 infections in three additional rhesus macaques up to a year post-primary ZIKV infection. Although cross-binding antibodies were detected prior to secondary infection for all animals and cross-neutralizing antibodies were detected for some animals, previous DENV or ZIKV infection had no apparent effect on the clinical course of heterotypic secondary infections in these animals. All animals had asymptomatic infections and, when compared to controls, did not have significantly perturbed hematological parameters. Rhesus macaques infected with DENV-2 approximately one year after primary ZIKV infection had higher vRNA loads in plasma when compared with serum vRNA loads from ZIKV-naive animals infected with DENV-2, but a differential effect of sample type could not be ruled out. In cynomolgus macaques, the serotype of primary DENV infection did not affect the outcome of secondary ZIKV infection. <br>	1350	242	8
Dengue fever in Southern of Vietnam: A survey of reported knowledge, attitudes, and practices.	<b>Objective:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever (DF) is an acute infectious disease with high incidence in tropical countries, such as Vietnam, where dengue prevention is a challenge for the health sector, government, and policy makers. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices in southern Vietnam and explore their relationships with the characteristics of the people. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cross-sectional study was conducted, using interviews with 1,906 urban participants and 493 rural participants in southern Vietnam in July 2018. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe study found a lack of knowledge regarding DF symptoms, with only 37.2% having a good level of knowledge, although 57.1% had good attitudes and 56.1% had good practices. Television (85.4 %) and the internet (69.5%) were the two main sources of information, and information provided by healthcare professionals was low. Participants with good knowledge had approximately 1.7 times the probability of having a good attitude and 5.0 times the probability of having good practices of those without. Urban participants had 1.3 times the level of knowledge than those in rural areas (p = 0.025), while the quality of attitude scores of rural participants was 1.3 times (p = 0.029) that of urban participants. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspImprovements in knowledge of DF, as well as in attitudes and practices toward dengue, are required, such as might be achieved through increased publicity and knowledge dissemination. <br>	1191	652	7
Revisiting dengue-related knowledge, attitudes and practices: A cross-sectional study in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 2018.	<b>Objective:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn recent years, Vietnam has been recorded as one of the most endemic areas of dengue fever (DF). Thus, controlling DF has become a matter of concern to healthcare professionals and the government. Nevertheless, there has been little research exploring inhabitants' awareness about DF in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The aims of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding DF by the population in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn July 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,175 people in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, using an administered questionnaire. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnly 38% of participants had good knowledge, and 55% of the population reached the satisfactory practices score, while 74% showed positive attitudes relating to DF. Unlike many other studies, education level was not associated with KAP score. However, marital status and monthly income seemed to be related to participants' knowledge levels. In addition, the main sources of information in this research were television and the Internet. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study showed that participants lacked knowledge regarding DF and practices to prevent it. These results recommend improving the population's knowledge andpractices through campaigns aimed at preventing breeding of mosquitoes. <br>	1077	616	11
Knowledge, attitudes, and practices among university students in relation to dengue fever: A multi-center study across Vietnamese regions.	<b>Objective:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever (DF) is a serious illness worldwide that can spread rapidly and become a dangerous epidemic. Vietnam is an endemic country affected by the health and economic burden of dengue. This study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to DF among university students across Vietnam. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA student-based cross-sectional study was performed with a structured questionnaire in Vietnam between July and September 2018. A Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare different issues between two student groups, including medical and non-medical student, and P-values of <0.05 were considered significant. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 1,542 students from universities in Vietnam responded to the survey, which was reflective of 315 medical students learning in public schools, 689 medical students learning in private schools, and 538 non-medical students. The majority of participants had good knowledge on the transmission of DF, good attitudes toward DF, and good practices to prevent the disease. Medical students had better knowledge of the signs and symptoms than non-medical students. However, both student groups' knowledge of signs and symptoms was low. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspQuality of education is a key determinant of the knowledge of the disease, as well as of attitudes and practices. This study supported the government's implementation of intervention projects and DF prevention campaigns and its positive participation in the community. <br>	1245	654	10
Seroprevalence of Dengue Virus Among Pregnant Women in Guangdong, China.	Guangdong is a main dengue epidemic area in China and undergoes dengue outbreaks frequently. In 2014, Guangdong experienced a serious dengue outbreak with 45,224 confirmed cases and six deaths, which might affect the seroprevalence among the local population. There is evidence that dengue virus (DENV) infection during pregnancy may cause adverse outcomes. Therefore, it is important to assess the seroprevalence of DENV among Guangdong pregnant women. We aimed to survey the seroprevalence of anti-DENV antibodies among pregnant women in Guangdong and to analyze the features of different seroprofiles. We collected a total 951 samples from pregnant women living in Guangdong in 2016. All serum samples were screened for DENV-specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed using capture ELISA. In IgM-positive samples, we performed DENV RNA detection using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We collected information of delivery outcomes, neonate features, and clinical laboratory variables of parturients and newborns following delivery. Seroprevalence of DENV among the women in our sample was 4.31%. A total 1.26% and 3.15% of samples were IgM and IgG positive, respectively. In addition, 22.22% of IgM-positive and 9.09% of IgG-positive participants had adverse outcomes. There was no difference with respect to adverse outcomes compared with controls (8.80%) who were IgG and IgM negative. There was no difference in clinical laboratory variables among the different seroprofiles. We found a high seroprevalence of DENV among pregnant women in Guangdong comparing with the overall seroprevalence of local population before 2014. Asymptomatic DENV infection during pregnancy was not found to contribute to adverse outcomes. <br>	1545	274	14
Significance of RANTES-CCR5 axis and linked downstream immunomodulation in Dengue pathogenesis: A study from Guwahati, India.	We aimed to evaluate the significance of the RANTES-CCR5 axis and resulting immunomodulatory status in Dengue pathogenesis involving a Guwahati, India based population where Dengue cases have increased alarmingly. An increased CC-chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) messenger RNA expression and CCR5 positive cell count profile was observed in Dengue cases, the highest being in severe cases. CCR5 ligand RANTES expression was significantly decreased in Dengue cases and inversely correlated with Dengue viremia fold change in severe cases. Monocytes are involved in Dengue virus homing and replication. Its levels and activation profile were higher in Dengue cases. A hyper Th1-biased immunomodulatory profile with upregulated tumor necrosis factor-α levels, and downregulated expression of antiviral cytokine interferon-γ and key regulatory Th2 anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 was observed in severe Dengue cases compared with mild Dengue cases and controls. The results, therefore, suggest the significance of RANTES-CCR5 axis deregulation and resulting altered immunomodulation in Dengue pathogenesis, and holds prognostic and therapeutic significance. <br>	1011	167	7
Dengue and Zika Virus Domain III-Flagellin Fusion and Glycan-Masking E Antigen for Prime-Boost Immunization.	The viral E proteins of dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are the major viral proteins involved in receptor binding and fusion, and for the induction of protective antibodies against viral infections. DIII of the E proteins is an independent domain and stretches out on the virion surface that can elicit type-specific neutralizing antibodies. For recombinant DIII vaccine development, prime-boost immunizations can provide an advantage of eliciting more type-specific neutralizing antibodies by recalling DIII antigens after DIII booster to improve protection. Methods: The DIII of the E genes of DENV and ZIKV were fused with bacterial fliC gene for the expression of flagellin-DIII (FliC-DIII) fusion proteins. Prime-boost immunization strategies by the second-dose booster of four DENV serotype or ZIKV FliC-DIII fusion proteins were used to investigate the induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection against viral infections. Cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies in each group of antisera were also examined using in vitro antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay. A series of glycan-masking E antigens were finally constructed for prime-boost immunizations to abolish the elicitation of cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies for ADE activity. Results: We showed that inclusion of a bivalent live-attenuated vaccine with a FliC-DIII booster is superior in eliciting neutralization titers and protection in vivo against all four-serotype DENVs. We also demonstrated that recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding four-serotype DENV prMEs with a FliC-DIII prime-boost scheme is capable of eliciting good antibody responses. In contract, recombinant adenovirus vector of ZIKV prME gene priming, followed by ZIKV FliC-DIII booster did not improve vaccine efficacy. The glycan-masking mutation on the ZIKV E protein ij loop (E-248NHT), but not on DENV2 E protein ij loop (E-242NHT), resulted in abolishing the elicitation of cross-reactive antibodies for DENV and ZIKV infection enhancements. Conclusions: Our findings can provide useful information for designing novel immunogens and vaccination strategies in an attempt to develop a safe and efficacious DENV or ZIKV vaccine. <br>	1901	338	12
Risk assessment of dengue autochthonous infections in Tokyo in summer, especially in the period of the 2020 Olympic Games.	In Tokyo, Japan, an outbreak of autochthonous dengue fever occurred in summer of 2014. In summer of 2020, when the Olympic Games will be held, a lot of participants and spectators from abroad will visit Tokyo. This study is aiming at analyzing a risk of autochthonous dengue infections in Tokyo in summer and also an additional risk in the Olympiad by using a mathematical model. We developed a stochastic transmission model with the cooperation of seasonal factors which influence much on the transmission cycle of dengue virus, and carried out stochastic simulations for each of the scenarios provided adequately. We found that (1) the incidence of dengue autochthonous infections is predicted to be small number cases; (2) the local climate makes a great influence on a scale of dengue autochthonous infections; (3) the incidence reaches a peak in August and early September; and (4) there is a bare possibility of development into dengue outbreak. In the Olympiad held in summer of 2020, an additional risk of dengue autochthonous infections will amount to about the double of risk in normal years. <br>	928	182	5
Low to medium-low risk perception for dengue, chikungunya and Zika outbreaks by infectious diseases physicians in France, Western Europe.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMany tropical countries are currently experiencing dengue (DEN), chikungunya (CHIK) and also more recently Zika (ZIKA) epidemics (particularly in Latin America). Although the risk of transmission and spread of these infections in temperate regions remains a controversial issue, vector-borne diseases have been widely reported in the media and have been the focus of preventive strategies by national and international policy-makers and public health authorities. In this context, we wanted to determine the extent of risk perception in infectious diseases (ID) physicians of the current and future risk of arboviral disease introduction, autochthonous case development and epidemic scenarios in France, Western Europe. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo this aim, we developed an original standardized questionnaire survey which was disseminated by the French Infectious Diseases Society to ID physician members. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe found that ID physicians perceived the risk of introduction and outbreak development of DEN, CHIK and ZIKA in France to be low to medium-low. Generalized Linear Model(s) identified medical school training, the extent of professional experience, and awareness of the French national plan regarding arboviral infections as significant predictors for lower risk perception among respondents. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDespite the fact that arboviral diseases are increasingly being imported into France, sometimes resulting in sporadic autochtonous transmission, French ID physicians do not perceive the risk as high. Better communication and education targeting health professionals and citizens will be needed to enhance the effectiveness of the French national plan to prepare against arboviral diseases. <br>	1434	735	8
Larvicidal activity of essential oil from Vitex negundo and Vitex trifolia on dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe ability of Vitex trifolia and Vitex negundo essential oils to kill Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus larvae was evaluated. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe larvae were treated with their respective essential oils at 50-125 ppm concentration. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLC50 and LC90 for V. trifolia against Ae. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus, and those for V. negundo against Ae. aegypti were 57.7+0.4, 77.9+0.9 ppm and 55.17+3.14, 78.28+2.23 ppm, and 50.86+0.9, 73.12+1.3 ppm, respectively. Eucalyptol and caryophyllene were the major components in Vitex trifolia and Vitex negundo essential oil, respectively. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study revealed potential larvicidal properties of essential oil from V. trifolia. <br>	565	352	11
A review of dengue diagnostics and implications for surveillance and control.	Dengue is the world's most common arboviral infection, with almost 4 billion people estimated to be living at risk of dengue infection. A recently introduced vaccine is currently recommended only for seropositive individuals in a restricted age range determined by transmission intensity. With no effective dengue vaccine for the general population or any antiviral therapy, dengue control continues to rely heavily on vector control measures. Early and accurate diagnosis is important for guiding appropriate management and for disease surveillance to guide prompt dengue control interventions. However, major uncertainties exist in dengue diagnosis and this has important implications for all three. Dengue can be diagnosed clinically against predefined lists of signs and symptoms and by detection of dengue-specific antibodies, non-structural 1 antigen or viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. All of these methods have their limitations. This review aims to describe and quantify the advantages, uncertainties and variability of the various diagnostic methods used for dengue and discuss their implications and applications for dengue surveillance and control. <br>	1028	173	8

Spatial diffusion of the 2015-2016 Zika, dengue and chikungunya epidemics in Rio de Janeiro Municipality, Brazil.	Different countries, especially Brazil, that have faced recurrent dengue epidemics for decades and chikungunya epidemics since 2014, have had to restructure their health services to combat a triple epidemic of arboviruses - Zika, dengue and Chikungunya - transmitted by the same vector, mainly Aedes aegypti, in 2015-2016. Several efforts have been made to better understand these three arboviruses. Spatial analysis plays an important role in the knowledge of disease dynamics. The knowledge of the patterns of spatial diffusion of these three arboviruses during an epidemic can contribute to the planning of surveillance actions and control of these diseases. This study aimed to identify the spatial diffusion processes of these viruses in the context of the triple epidemic in 2015-2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Two study designs were used: cross-sectional and ecological. Sequential Kernel maps, nearest-neighbour ratios calculated cumulatively over time, Moran global autocorrelation correlograms, and local autocorrelation changes over time were used to identify spatial diffusion patterns. The results suggested an expansion diffusion pattern for the three arboviruses during 2015-2016 in Rio de Janeiro. These findings can be considered for more effective control measures and for new studies on the dynamics of these three arboviruses. <br>	1157	201	8
Prior Dengue Virus Infection Is Associated With Increased Viral Load in Patients Infected With Dengue but Not Zika Virus.	To evaluate potential enhancement of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection among patients with prior dengue virus (DENV) infection, we compared loads of viral RNA among patients infected with ZIKV (n = 1070), DENV-2 (n = 312), or DENV-3 (n = 260). Compared to patients without prior DENV infection, patients with prior DENV infection had significantly higher mean loads of viral RNA if infected with DENV-2 (10.6 vs 11.6 log10 GCE/mL, respectively; t test, P < .0001) or DENV-3 (10.3 vs 10.9 log10 GCE/mL; P < .0001), but not ZIKV (4.7 vs 4.7 log10 GCE/mL; P = .959). These findings provide evidence against in vivo enhancement of ZIKV by anti-DENV antibodies. <br>	547	119	3
