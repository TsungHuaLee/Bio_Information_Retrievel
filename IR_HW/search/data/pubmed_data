Development of a highly sensitive magneto-enzyme lateral flow immunoassay for dengue NS1 detection.	<b>Background:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue infection represents a global health issue of growing importance. Dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) plays a central role in the early detection of the disease. The most common method for NS1 detection is testing by lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) with varying sensitivity. In this study, we present a highly sensitive magneto-enzyme LFIA for prompt diagnosis of dengue. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe have demonstrated the development of a magneto-enzyme LFIA combining super-paramagnetic nanoparticles as labels and Biotin-Streptavidin signal amplification strategy to detect dengue NS1. Factors affecting the test performance including antibody pair, super-paramagnetic nanoparticle size, nitrocellulose membrane type, amounts of detection and capture antibodies, and amounts of Streptavidin-polyHRP were optimized. Analytical sensitivity and cross-reactivity were determined. Clinical performance of the novel assay was evaluated using a panel of 120 clinical sera. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis newly developed assay could detect NS1 of all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be as low as 0.25 ng ml-1 for DENV-1 and DENV-3, 0.1 ng ml-1 for DENV-2, and 1.0 ng ml-1 for DENV-4. The LOD for DENV-2 was a 50-fold improvement over the best values previously reported. There was an absence of cross-reactivity with Zika NS1, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. The sensitivity and specificity of the novel assay were 100% when tested on clinical samples. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe have successfully developed a magneto-enzyme LFIA, allowing rapid and highly sensitive detection of dengue NS1, which is essential for proper management of patients infected with DENV. <br>	1439	792	14
Association of ABO blood groups with dengue fever and its complications in a tertiary care hospital.	<b>CONTEXT:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever (DF) has been steadily increasing in India with outbreaks in certain areas taking the proportion of epidemics. Along with secondary dengue, several risk factors predispose to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Very few studies associating the relationship between dengue and its severity with ABO blood group have been documented. <br><b>AIMS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of this study was to determine the association between distribution of ABO Rh blood groups and DF and DF with thrombocytopenia. <br><b>SETTINGS AND DESIGN:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis was a retrospective descriptive study conducted at the clinical laboratory of the department of microbiology. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue patients whose case record contained information on blood group were screened for details of blood group and confirmed dengue diagnosis. Randomly 384 case records were selected. These were divided into two groups; Group 1 included DF cases (platelet count >20,000) and Group 2 included DF cases with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20,000). Control group consisted of patients other than dengue, whose blood grouping had been done; randomly 390 were selected and analyzed. <br><b>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspP value was calculated using the Chi-square test. Odds ratio were calculated using the Fisher's exact test. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDF was higher in 23% of individuals with AB blood group as compared to 8.5% of controls (P = 0.0004), whereas patients with blood group O were significantly less affected with DF (P = 0.0048). Disease severity was not associated with any of the blood groups. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIndividuals with AB blood group are more prone to DF, whereas individuals with blood group O are less prone. <br>	1331	1310	14
Role of Interleukin-10 and Abdominopelvic Ultrasound as a Potential Predictor of Disease Severity in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever.	Introduction Dengue viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical/subtropical countries. Early and prompt detection of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), though challenging, is helpful to identify an individual that would benefit from intensive therapy. Objective The goal of this study was to determine the plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in DHF patients at four to seven days of disease onset and 24 hours after the first sample. We also aimed to determine the association of plasma IL-10 levels and abdominopelvic ultrasound findings. Methods A total of 50 registered DHF patients aged 15 to 50 years were recruited. Plasma IL-10 concentration measurements and abdominopelvic ultrasounds were performed. Patients were also categorized based on ultrasound grading I to IV (based on severity). Outcomes were described as recovery and shock. Platelet count and hematocrit percentages were also recorded. Results Plasma IL-10 levels were elevated in DHF patients and associated with fatal outcomes (p = 0.00). Binary regression-coefficient showed the direct effect of high levels of plasma IL-10 on the fatal outcome of patients 24 hours after the first sample (p = 0.04). Disease severity was predicted by a positive correlation between ultrasound grades and outcomes (p = 0.00). Spearman's correlation coefficient found a highly significant inverse relationship between plasma IL-10 levels and platelet count after 24 hours (p = 0.01). However, a significant positive relationship was observed between elevated plasma IL-10 levels and hematocrit percentage after 24 hours (p = 0.01). Conclusion Elevated plasma IL-10 levels and abdominopelvic ultrasonography are promising potential predictors of disease progression and fatal outcome in DHF patients. <br>	1526	276	15

Dengue Fever with Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis : Sensorium Imbroglio.	Dengue is the most common arboviral disease affecting many countries worldwide. With endemicity of the disease and huge burden, atypical clinical presentations occur posing high diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Emerging neurological complications in dengue fever are reported in recent past Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune mediated acute demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system following recent infection or vaccination and characterized by multifocal white matter involvement. Early suspicion and diagnosis of such complication is clinical dilemma and it further complicates the clinical scenario. This case report highlights occurrence of such uncommon manifestation of ADEM in commonly occurring dengue fever along with its diagnosis and successful management in a young individual. <br>	720	114	5
Association of dengue virus-specific polyfunctional T-cell responses with clinical disease severity in acute dengue infection.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough the role of dengue virus (DENV)-specific T cells in the pathogenesis of acute dengue infection is emerging, the functionality of virus-specific T cells associated with milder clinical disease has not been well studied. We sought to investigate how the functionality of DENV-NS3 and DENV-NS5 protein-specific T cells differ in patients with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing intracellular cytokine assays, we assessed the production of interferon γ (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), and CD107a expression in adult patients with acute DF (n = 21) and DHF (n = 22). <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspQuadruple cytokine-producing, polyfunctional DENV-NS3- and DENV-NS5-specific T cells were more frequent in those with DF when compared to those with DHF. While DENV-NS3- and DENV-NS5-specific T cells in patients with DF expressed IFNγ > TNF-α > MIP-β > CD107a, T cells of those with DHF predominantly expressed CD107a > MIP-1β > IFNγ > TNF-α. Overall production of IFNγ or TNF-α by DENV-NS3- and DENV-NS5-specific T cells was significantly higher in patients with DF. The majority of NS3-specific T cells in patients with DF (78.6%) and DHF (68.9%) were single-cytokine producers; 76.6% of DENV-NS5-specific T cells in those with DF and 77.1% of those with DHF, produced only a single cytokine. However, no significant association was found with polyfunctional T-cell responses and the degree of viraemia. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur results suggest that the functional phenotype of DENV-specific T cells are likely to associate with clinical disease severity. <br>	1350	767	9
Cross-Reaction, Enhancement, and Neutralization Activity of Dengue Virus Antibodies against Zika Virus: A Study in the Mexican Population.	Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, has quickly spread in many regions around the world where dengue virus (DENV) is endemic. This represents a major health concern, given the high homology between these two viruses, which can result in cross-reactivity. The aim of this study was to determine the cross-reacting antibody response of the IgM and IgG classes against the recombinant envelope protein of ZIKV (rE-ZIKV) in sera from patients with acute-phase infection of different clinical forms of dengue, i.e., dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (before the arrival of ZIKV in Mexico 2010), as well as acute-phase sera of ZIKV patients, together with the implications in neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement. Differences in IgM responses were observed in a number of DF and DHF patients whose sera cross-reacted with the rE-ZIK antigen, with 42% recognition between acute-phase DHF and ZIKV but 27% recognition between DF and ZIKV. Regarding IgG antibodies, 71.5% from the DF group showed cross-reactivity to rE-ZIKV in contrast with 50% and only 25% of DHF and ZIKV serum samples, respectively, which specifically recognized the homologous antigen. The DHF group showed more enhancement of ZIKV infection of FCRγ-expressing cells compared to the DF group. Furthermore, the DHF group also showed a higher cross-neutralizing ability than that of DF. This is the first report where DF and DHF serum samples were evaluated for cross-reactivity against Zika protein and ZIKV. Furthermore, DENV serum samples cross-protect against ZIKV through neutralizing antibodies but at the same time mediate antibody-dependent enhancement in the sequential ZIKV infection. <br>	1459	277	9
Predictors of Major Bleeding and Mortality in Dengue Infection: A Retrospective Observational Study in a Tertiary Care Centre in South India.	We conducted a retrospective observational study to describe the clinical profile and outcomes of patients admitted with a diagnosis of dengue fever in a tertiary hospital in South India. A total of 159 patients admitted from April 2014 to October 2018 were included in the study. Vomiting (70.4%), myalgia (60.4%), headache (42.1%), abdominal pain (38.4%), bleeding (38%), and rash (37.1%) were the most common symptoms at presentation. The mean duration of hospital stay was 4.9 days (SD ± 2.4), and the median cost was INR 19,708 ($285) (IQR INR 12,968-32,056 ($188-$305)). Major bleeding was associated with elevated SGOT and SGPT, severe dengue, and secondary dengue. Mortality was associated with elderly age; elevated total leukocyte count, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, SGOT, and SGPT; and high SOFA score. In view of these observations, we recommend stratifying patients according to the WHO classification of dengue and avoiding the use of thrombocytopenia as a single marker of the severity of the illness. <br>	870	171	7
Serological tests reveal significant cross-reactive human antibody responses to Zika and Dengue viruses in the Mexican population.	Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has caused recent large outbreaks in the Americas. Given its association with severe congenital defects including microcephaly, distinguishing infections caused by ZIKV from those caused by dengue virus (DENV) is of primordial importance. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the recombinant proteins rEIII-ZIKV (Envelope protein domain III) and rNS1ß-leader-ZIKV (non-structural protein 1) for the serological diagnosis of ZIKV in the Mexican population. We also evaluated potential cross-reactivity in commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) based on the ZIKV NS1 and DENV NS1 proteins. rEIII-ZIKV and rNS1ß-leader-ZIKV proteins were tested with sera from 30 PCR-confirmed ZIKV cases, 50 ZIKV-naïve, DENV-exposed subjects with no acute febrile disease, (asymptomatic subjects, AS), and 50 ZIKV-naive and DENV naïve AS. Commercial ELISA tests were evaluated with sera from 57 ZIKV and 20 DENV PCR-confirmed cases, and 50 ZIKV-naïve, DENV-exposed AS. In-house ELISA assays showed that IgM antibody levels against rEIII-ZIKV and rNS1ß-ZIKV were higher in ZIKV naïve, DENV-exposed AS than in acutely infected ZIKV individuals. IgG reactivity was highest for rEIII-ZIKV, and indistinguishable between acutely infected ZIKV cases and DENV exposed AS. Positivity for the Euroimmun Zika IgM assay at 7-10 days was considerably higher in DENV-naïve ZIKV patients (86%) than in DENV-exposed ZIKV patients (33%), while 39% of the latter had false-negative anti-ZIKV IgG before 7 days of onset. DENV-exposed ZIKV patients presented lower anti-ZIKV IgM and higher IgG responses similar to a secondary dengue response. Forty-four percent of DENV- exposed acute ZIKV patients were DENV IgM positive with the Panbio Dengue assay, and two (15%) of the DENV-naïve ZIKV patients presented false DENV IgG conversion. Given the extensive cross-reactivity to both the NS1 and EDIII proteins in current serological methods, the development of sensitive and specific serological tests to distinguish ZIKV from DENV infections is an urgent priority. <br>	1805	338	12
Discovery of 3-Arylquinoxaline Derivatives as Potential Anti-Dengue Virus Agents.	We designed and synthesized a series of novel 3-arylquinoxaline derivatives and evaluated their biological activities as potential dengue virus (DENV) replication inhibitors. Among them, [3-(4-methoxyphenyl)quinoxalin-2-yl](phenyl)methanol (19a), [6,7-dichloro-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)quinoxalin-2-yl](phenyl)methanol (20a), and (4-methoxyphenyl)(3-phenylquinoxalin-2-yl)methanone (21b) were found to significantly inhibit the DENV RNA expression in Huh-7-DV-Fluc cells with a potency better than that of ribavirin. Compound 19a reduced DENV replication in both viral protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited no significant cell cytotoxicity. Notably, compound 19a exhibited a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) value at 1.29 ± 0.74 μM. We further observed that the inhibitory effect of 19a on DENV replication was due to suppression of DENV-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Docking studies also showed that 19a caused hydrophobic interactions at the active sites with Arg29, Glu31, Tyr116, Leu138, Pro139, Lys454, Arg455, and Gln529. The calculated lowest binding energy between the 19a and COX-2 was -9.10 kcal/mol. In conclusion, compound 19a might be a potential lead compound for developing an anti-DENV agent. <br>	1114	201	7
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) modulates host cellular autophagy progression in sub genomic dengue virus-2 replicon cells.	Cellular autophagy (Macrophagy) is a self-degradative process, executed through the network of autophagy associated genes (ATGs) encoded proteins. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that dengue virus (DENV) induces autophagy and supports the viral genome replication and translation. Therefore, the cellular autophagy induced by dengue virus can be a good target for antiviral drug development. The action of mycophenolic acid (MPA), a specific inhibitor of DENV replication, was investigated in the stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells. The inhibition was mediated by enhanced degradation of autophagic substrates in stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells as evidenced by a decrease in lapidated LC3 (LC3II) and p62 expression in the presence of MPA. In contrast, the results indicated that four gene sets, namely Trans membrane protein 74 (TMEM74), Unc-51-like kinase 2 (ULK2), Cathepsin D (CTSD) and Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) were upregulated in stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells, due to the sustained dynamic replication of DENV2 genome. These ATGs involved in the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) formation, were suppressed in the presence MPA. Instead, MPA induced the expression of different set of autophagy genes such as ATG4, AKT1, APP, ATG16L1, ATG16L2, B2M and HPRT1. An enzyme involved in the nucleotide salvage pathway, HPRT1, was highly expressed in the presence of MPA. The study shows that DENV2 replication is dependent on PAS formation and is inhibited in the presence of MPA by enhancing the degradation of autophagic substrates and suppression of PAS formation. This study provides impetus in designing MPA analogues to effectively inhibit dengue viral replication. <br>	1447	262	11
A Study on Cardiac Manifestations of Dengue Fever.	<b>Aims:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIncidence of cardiac involvement in dengue fever varies between 15 -50%. Cardiac manifestations of dengue fever include asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, transient AV blocks, transient ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis and pericardial effusion. This study was done with the objective of finding actual incidence of different cardiac manifestations of dengue fever in our tertiary care hospital. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne hundred and twenty dengue patients were studied between January 2016 to December 2017. Routine biochemical parameters like complete haemogram, liver function tests, renal function tests, electrolytes were checked in all cases. ECG, echocardiography, Troponin T were evaluated in every patients and they were corroborated with clinical features like chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitation. Patients with electrolyte abnormalities, preexisting heart disease, drugs interfering with heart rhythm were excluded from study. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFifteen patients had cardiac involvement (12.5%). Eight patient had bradyarrhythmias (6.6%). Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia was commonest (3.3%). All had normal recovery within two weeks. Four patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 35% - 45%) and there was spontaneous recovery within three months. Two patients had pericardial effusion which resolved within two weeks. Transient 2.1 AV block and atrial fibrillation were observed in two cases. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCardiac manifestations of Dengue were present in 11.4 % of our patents. Brady arrhythmias (6.6%) were commonest manifestation which resolves spontaneously within seven to fourteen days. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was present in 3.3% of patients which recovered within three months. Pericardial effusion was seen in 2.5% of patients. There were no significant tachyarrhythmias in our patients except one case of atrial fibrillation. <br>	1586	707	18

One-step pentaplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for detection of zika, dengue, chikungunya, West nile viruses and a human housekeeping gene.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRecent emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV), and the global spread of dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV) and West Nile viruses (WNV) raised urgent need of accurate and affordable molecular diagnosis of these clinically indistinguishable arboviral infections. <br><b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe established a pentaplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay (CII-ArboViroPlex rRT-PCR) for specific and sensitive detection of the African and American genotypes of ZIKV, all four serotypes of DENV, CHIKV, WNV and a housekeeping gene as internal control in single reaction. <br><b>STUDY DESIGN:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSpecific primers and probe sets were designed for ZIKV, DENV, CHIKV, WNV and RNase P (housekeeping gene) and tested for in-vitro transcribed RNA standards, virus cultures, clinical samples positive for ZIKV, DENV, CHIKV and WNV and limit of detection (LOD) were determined for each. Results Using ten-fold serially diluted in-vitro transcribed RNA, CII- ArboViroPlex rRT-PCR assay has LOD of 100 RNA copies/reaction (Rn) for ZIKV in serum or urine, 100 RNA copies/Rn for DENV in serum, and 10 RNA copies/Rn for CHIKV and WNV in serum. LODs from sera spiked with quantitated viral stocks were 2.6 × 102 GEQ/Rn for ZIKV, 2.2 × 101 GEQ/Rn for DENV-1, 9.4 × 100 GEQ/Rn for DENV-2, 2.3 × 102 GEQ/Rn for DENV-3, 1.4 × 103 GEQ/Rn for DENV-4, 2.7 × 102 GEQ/Rn for CHIKV, and 1.05 × 101 GEQ/Rn for WNV. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe CII-ArboViroPlex rRT-PCR assay is a quantitative one-step pentaplex rRT-PCR assay for the molecular detection and differential diagnosis of ZIKV, DENV, CHIKV, WNV and a human housekeeping gene control in a single- PCR reaction. <br>	1327	714	6
A vector-host model to assess the impact of superinfection exclusion on vaccination strategies using dengue and yellow fever as case studies.	Superinfection exclusion is a phenomenon whereby the co-infection of a host with a secondary pathogen is prevented due to a current infection by another closely-related pathogenic strain. We construct a novel vector-host mathematical model for two pathogens that exhibit superinfection exclusion and simultaneously account for vaccination strategies against them. We then derive the conditions under which an endemic disease will prevent the establishment of another through the action of superinfection exclusion and show that vaccination against the endemic strain can enable the previously suppressed strain to invade the population. Through appropriate parameterisation of the model for dengue and yellow fever we find that superinfection exclusion alone is unlikely to explain the absence of yellow fever in many regions where dengue is endemic, and that the rollout of the recently licensed dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, is unlikely to enable the establishment of Yellow Fever in regions where it has previously been absent. <br>	883	155	4
Bauhinia holophylla (Bong.) Steud. leaves-derived extracts as potent anti-dengue serotype 2.	Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral pathogen and made the disease a major health concern worldwide. However, specific antiviral drugs against this arbovirose or vaccines are not yet available for treatment or prevention. Thus, here we aimed to study the antiviral activity of hydroethanolic extract, fraction ethyl acetate and subfractions of the leaves of Bauhinia holophylla (Fabaceae:Cercideae), a native plant of the Brazilian Cerrado, against DENV-2 by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method in mammalian cells culture. As results, the hydroethanolic extract showed the most potent effect, with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.2 μg mL-1 and selectivity index (SI) of 27.6, approximately 16-times higher anti-DENV-2 activity than of the ribavirin (IC50 52.8 μg mL-1). Our results showed in this study appointed that B. holophylla has a promising anti-dengue activity, which was associated mainly with the presence of flavonoids. <br>	851	155	6
Development of peptide biosensor for the detection of dengue fever biomarker, nonstructural 1.	Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein is a specific and sensitive biomarker for the diagnosis of dengue. In this study, an efficient electrochemical biosensor that uses chemically modified affinity peptides was developed for the detection of dengue virus NS1. A series of amino acid-substituted synthetic peptides was rationally designed, chemically synthesized and covalently immobilized to a gold sensor surface. The sensor performance was monitored via square wave voltammetry (SWV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Potential affinity peptides specific for NS1 were chosen according to the dynamic current decrease in SWV experiments. Using circular dichroism, the molar ellipticity of peptides (DGV BP1-BP5) was determined, indicating that they had a mostly similar in random coil structure, not totally identical. Using SWV, DGV BP1 was selected as a promising recognition peptide and limit of detection for NS1 was found to be 1.49 μg/mL by the 3-sigma rule. DGV BP1 showed good specificity and stability for NS1, with low signal interference. The validation of the sensor to detect NS1 proteins was confirmed with four dengue virus culture broth (from serotype 1 to 4) as proof-of-concept. The detection performance of our sensor incorporating DGV BP1 peptides showed a statistically significant difference. These results indicate that this strategy can potentially be used to detect the dengue virus antigen, NS1, and to diagnosis dengue fever within a miniaturized portable device in point-of-care testing. <br>	1323	238	11
Reducing the cost and assessing the performance of a novel adult mass-rearing cage for the dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika vector, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus).	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe widespread emergence of resistance to insecticides used to control adult Aedes mosquitoes has made traditional control strategies inadequate for the reduction of various vector populations. Therefore, complementary vector control methods, such as the Sterile Insect Technique, are needed to enhance existing efforts. The technique relies on the rearing and release of large numbers of sterile males, and the development of efficient and standardized mass-rearing procedures and tools is essential for its application against medically important mosquitoes. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the effort to reduce the cost of the rearing process, a prototype low-cost plexiglass mass-rearing cage has been developed and tested for egg production and egg hatch rate in comparison to the current Food and Agriculture Organization/International Atomic Energy Agency (FAO/IAEA) stainless-steel cage. Additionally, an adult-index was validated and used as a proxy to estimate the mosquito survival rates by counting the number of male and female mosquitoes that were resting within each of the 6 squares at a given point of time each day in the cage. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe study has shown that the prototype mass-rearing cage is cheap and is as efficient as the FAO/IAEA stainless-steel cage in terms of egg production, with even better overall egg hatch rate. The mean numbers of eggs per cage, after seven cycles of blood feeding and egg collection, were 969,789 ± 138,101 and 779,970 ± 123,042, corresponding to 81 ± 11 and 65 ± 10 eggs per female over her lifespan, in the prototype and the stainless-steel-mass-rearing cages, respectively. The longevity of adult male and female mosquitoes was not affected by cage type and, the adult-index could be considered as an appropriate proxy for survival. Moreover, the mass-rearing cage prototype is easy to handle and transport and improves economic and logistic efficiency. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe low-cost mass-rearing prototype cage can be recommended to produce Ae. aegypti in the context of rear and release techniques. The proposed adult-index can be used as a quick proxy of mosquito survival rates in mass-rearing settings. <br>	1789	982	12

Community perception and risk reduction practices toward malaria and dengue: A mixed-method study in slums of Chetla, Kolkata.	<b>Background:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGlobally, vector-borne diseases account for 17% of infectious disease burden. In India, despite accelerated efforts, both malaria and dengue are major public health concern. Understanding local community perspectives is essential to strengthen ongoing program activities. <br><b>Objectives:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe study aimed to assess the community perceptions and risk reduction practices toward prevention and control of malaria and dengue at slums of Chetla in South Kolkata and to explore the perspectives of relevant local stakeholders in this regard. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis cross-sectional study with mixed-method design was conducted from June to September 2018. Quantitative data were collected in 288 sampled households through face-to-face interview of respondents and environmental checklist, whereas, qualitative exploration was done with five key informant interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 Software. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically using "cut and sort" processing technique. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn household survey, majority had unsatisfactory knowledge (68.4%), attitude (64.2%), and practices (62.8%) regarding diseases prevention/control, which was further substantiated by qualitative findings. The use of electric fans (79.5%), mosquito repellents (53.8%) were predominant practices; however, only a few used bed nets regularly (26.0%). Reportedly, "heat" and "poor ventilation" were key reasons behind reluctance to use bed nets. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that increasing age, proximity to a nearby canal, and unsatisfactory knowledge significantly predicted unfavorable attitude, whereas, respondents' gender and unfavorable attitude significantly predicted poor practices. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIntensified social behavior change communication with active community participation is the need of the hour to prevent malaria and dengue occurrence and future outbreaks. <br>	1614	862	12
Human T Cell Response to Dengue Virus Infection.	DENV is a major public health problem worldwide, thus underlining the overall significance of the proposed Program. The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (1-4) cause the most common mosquito-borne viral disease of humans, with 3 billion people at risk for infection and up to 100 million cases each year, most often affecting children. The protective role of T cells during viral infection is well-established. Generally, CD8 T cells can control viral infection through several mechanisms, including direct cytotoxicity, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α. Similarly, CD4 T cells are thought to control viral infection through multiple mechanisms, including enhancement of B and CD8 T cell responses, production of inflammatory and anti-viral cytokines, cytotoxicity, and promotion of memory responses. To probe the phenotype of virus-specific T cells, epitopes derived from viral sequences need to be known. Here we discuss the identification of CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes derived from DENV and how these epitopes have been used by researchers to interrogate the phenotype and function of DENV-specific T cell populations. <br>	991	185	7
Phylogeography and invasion history of Aedes aegypti, the Dengue and Zika mosquito vector in Cape Verde islands (West Africa).	Aedes-borne arboviruses have spread globally with outbreaks of vast impact on human populations and health systems. The West African archipelago of Cape Verde had its first outbreak of Dengue in 2009, at the time the largest recorded in Africa, and was one of the few African countries affected by the Zika virus epidemic. Aedes aegypti was the mosquito vector involved in both outbreaks. We performed a phylogeographic and population genetics study of A. aegypti in Cape Verde in order to infer the geographic origin and evolutionary history of this mosquito. These results are discussed with respect to the implications for vector control and prevention of future outbreaks. Mosquitoes captured before and after the Dengue outbreak on the islands of Santiago, Brava, and Fogo were analyzed with two mitochondrial genes COI and ND4, 14 microsatellite loci and five kdr mutations. Genetic variability was comparable to other African populations. Our results suggest that A. aegypti invaded Cape Verde at the beginning of the Holocene from West Africa. Given the historic importance of Cape Verde in the transatlantic trade of the 16th-17th centuries, a possible contribution to the genetic pool of the founding populations in the New World cannot be fully discarded. However, contemporary gene flow with the Americas is likely to be infrequent. No kdr mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance were detected. The implications for vector control and prevention of future outbreaks are discussed. <br>	1274	236	14
Dengue in hospitalized children with sickle cell disease: A retrospective cohort study in the French departments of America.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo describe the characteristics of dengue in sickle cell children and try to identify risk factors of severity. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this retrospective study, we describe the evolution according to genotype (SS or SC and controls) and severity. <br><b>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom 2005 to 2013, 106 hospitalizations for dengue fever were recorded, 35 SS genotype, 35 SC and 36 without SCD or any other chronic disease. The clinical evolution was quite different. During hospitalization, SC patients were more likely to develop multiorgan failure (31.4% versus 25.7% for SS, and 0% for controls, p=0.001), or acute pulmonary complications than patients without SC sickle cell disease (14.3% versus 8.6% for SS, and 0% for controls, p=0.03). Level 3 analgesic treatment was more frequent in SC patients (22.9% versus 3% for SS, and 0% for controls, p<0.001). Patients with SC sickle cell disease had a higher proportion of severe forms of dengue (57.1% versus 37.1% for SS, and 0% for controls, p<0.001) than patients without SC sickle cell disease. Transfer in intensive care unit was required for most SC patients (22.9% versus 3% for SS, and 0% for controls, p=0.005).Fatal episodes were more frequent in SC patients than in patients without SC sickle cell disease (5 deaths versus 1 for SS and 0 for controls, p=0.02). Thirty-three patients (47.1%) were diagnosed as having severe dengue (13 SS and 20 SC). On univariate analysis, age >10 years, acute pulmonary complications, multiorgan failure, severe anemia requiring transfusion, use of antibiotic treatment, need for treatment with morphine, and longer hospital stay were statistically more frequent in severe dengue-associated cases. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that HbSC genotype and acute pulmonary complications, were significantly associated with severe dengue. In the multivariate model, the area of the ROC curve was 0.831. Children with SC genotype, typically thought to have less severe disease, actually had a higher rate of severe dengue and death than those with SS genotype. <br>	1702	446	12
The clinical profile, hematological parameters and liver transaminases of dengue NS1 Ag positive patients admitted to Jaffna Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspObjective of the study is to evaluate the on-admission day symptoms and signs, clinical, hematological parameters and liver transaminases of the dengue NS1 positive patients who got admitted on different clinical phases [Febrile phase (day 1-3) and Critical phase(day 4-5)] of dengue at medical wards of Jaffna Teaching Hospital. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlood samples were collected from 150 suspected dengue patients from day 1 to 5 of the illness. Seventy-eight patients were positive for dengue NS1, according to the WHO proposed dengue clinical phase framework 37 patients were from febrile phase and 41 patients from critical phase. Patients who admitted on critical phase framework suffered from leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Nine patients had the evidence of leakage with fever and the leakers had significant rise in hemoglobin, hematocrit and liver transaminase levels which are considered as severe form of the disease. <br>	774	221	5
Commentary: Dengue hemorrhagic fever: Panophthalmitis or sterile sclerocorneal melt?		0	0	0
Panophthalmitis associated with scleral necrosis in dengue hemorrhagic fever.	Dengue is a mosquito-borne flavivirus disease affecting humans. The Aedes aegypti mosquito spreads it. Ophthalmic manifestations of dengue range from subconjunctival hemorrhage to optic neuropathy. Panophthalmitis in dengue fever is a rare finding. We report a case of a 22-year-old male having dengue fever, who presented with pain, redness, swelling and loss of vision in his right eye. He was diagnosed as panophthalmitis with subretinal hemorrhage and required right eye evisceration. <br>	423	76	6
Scaled deployment of Wolbachia to protect the community from dengue and other  Aedes transmitted arboviruses.	Background: A number of new technologies are under development for the control of mosquito transmitted viruses, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika that all require the release of modified mosquitoes into the environment. None of these technologies has been able to demonstrate evidence that they can be implemented at a scale beyond small pilots. Here we report the first successful citywide scaled deployment of Wolbachia in the northern Australian city of Townsville. Methods: The wMel strain of Wolbachia was backcrossed into a local Aedes aegypti genotype and mass reared mosquitoes were deployed as eggs using mosquito release containers (MRCs). In initial stages these releases were undertaken by program staff but in later stages this was replaced by direct community release including the development of a school program that saw children undertake releases. Mosquito monitoring was undertaken with Biogents Sentinel (BGS) traps and individual mosquitoes were screened for the presence of Wolbachia with a Taqman qPCR or LAMP diagnostic assay. Dengue case notifications from Queensland Health Communicable Disease Branch were used to track dengue cases in the city before and after release. Results: Wolbachia was successfully established into local Ae. aegypti mosquitoes across 66 km 2 in four stages over 28 months with full community support.  A feature of the program was the development of a scaled approach to community engagement. Wolbachia frequencies have remained stable since deployment and to date no local dengue transmission has been confirmed in any area of Townsville after Wolbachia has established, despite local transmission events every year for the prior 13 years and an epidemiological context of increasing imported cases. Conclusion: Deployment of Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti populations can be readily scaled to areas of ~60km 2 quickly and cost effectively and appears in this context to be effective at stopping local dengue transmission. <br>	1681	301	13
Detecting space-time clusters of dengue fever in Panama after adjusting for vector surveillance data.	Long term surveillance of vectors and arboviruses is an integral aspect of disease prevention and control systems in countries affected by increasing risk. Yet, little effort has been made to adjust space-time risk estimation by integrating disease case counts with vector surveillance data, which may result in inaccurate risk projection when several vector species are present, and when little is known about their likely role in local transmission. Here, we integrate 13 years of dengue case surveillance and associated Aedes occurrence data across 462 localities in 63 districts to estimate the risk of infection in the Republic of Panama. Our exploratory space-time modelling approach detected the presence of five clusters, which varied by duration, relative risk, and spatial extent after incorporating vector species as covariates. The Ae. aegypti model contained the highest number of districts with more dengue cases than would be expected given baseline population levels, followed by the model accounting for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. This implies that arbovirus case surveillance coupled with entomological surveillance can affect cluster detection and risk estimation, potentially improving efforts to understand outbreak dynamics at national scales. <br>	1095	190	9
Dengue illness impacts daily human mobility patterns in Iquitos, Peru.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHuman mobility plays a central role in shaping pathogen transmission by generating spatial and/or individual variability in potential pathogen-transmitting contacts. Recent research has shown that symptomatic infection can influence human mobility and pathogen transmission dynamics. Better understanding the complex relationship between symptom severity, infectiousness, and human mobility requires quantification of movement patterns throughout infectiousness. For dengue virus (DENV), human infectiousness peaks 0-2 days after symptom onset, making it paramount to understand human movement patterns from the beginning of illness. <br><b>METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThrough community-based febrile surveillance and RT-PCR assays, we identified a cohort of DENV+ residents of the city of Iquitos, Peru (n = 63). Using retrospective interviews, we measured the movements of these individuals when healthy and during each day of symptomatic illness. The most dramatic changes in mobility occurred during the first three days after symptom onset; individuals visited significantly fewer locations (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.017) and spent significantly more time at home (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.005), compared to when healthy. By 7-9 days after symptom onset, mobility measures had returned to healthy levels. Throughout an individual's symptomatic period, the day of illness and their subjective sense of well-being were the most significant predictors for the number of locations and houses they visited. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur study is one of the first to collect and analyze human mobility data at a daily scale during symptomatic infection. Accounting for the observed changes in human mobility throughout illness will improve understanding of the impact of disease on DENV transmission dynamics and the interpretation of public health-based surveillance data. <br>	1552	614	11
Modelling the Host Immune Response to Mature and Immature Dengue Viruses.	Immature dengue virions contained in patient blood samples are essentially not infectious because the uncleaved surface protein prM renders them incompetent for membrane fusion. However, the immature virions regain full infectivity when they interact with anti-prM antibodies, and once opsonised virion fusion into Fc receptor-expressing cells is facilitated. We propose a within-host mathematical model for the immune response which takes into account the dichotomy between mature infectious and immature noninfectious dengue virions. The model accounts for experimental observations on the different interactions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells with infected cells producing virions with different infectivity. We compute the basic reproduction number as a function of the proportion of infected cells producing noninfectious virions and use numerical simulations to compare the host's immune response in a primary and a secondary dengue infections. The results can be placed in the immunoregulatory framework with plasmacytoid dendritic cells serving as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune response, and pose questions for potential experimental work to validate hypothesis about the evolutionary context whereby the virus strives to maximise its chance for transmission from the human host to the mosquito vector. <br>	1149	192	6
Dengue virus infection in people residing in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence studies.	Better knowledge of the face of the current dengue virus (DENV) epidemiology in Africa can help to implement efficient strategies to curb the burden of dengue fever. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of DENV infection in Africa. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, African Journals Online, and Africa Index Medicus from January 1st, 2000 to June 10th, 2019 without any language restriction. We used a random-effects model to pool studies. A total of 76 studies (80,977 participants; 24 countries) were included. No study had high risk of bias. Twenty-two (29%) had moderate and 54 (71%) had low risk of bias. In apparently healthy individuals, the pooled prevalence of DENV was 15.6% (95% confidence interval 9.9-22.2), 3.5% (0.8-7.8), and 0.0% (0.0-0.5) respectively for immunoglobulins (Ig) G, IgM, and for ribonucleic acid (RNA) in apparently healthy populations. In populations presenting with fever, the prevalence was 24.8% (13.8-37.8), 10.8% (3.8-20.6k) and 8.4% (3.7-14.4) for IgG, IgM, and for RNA respectively. There was heterogeneity in the distribution between different regions of Africa. The prevalence of DENV infection is high in the African continent. Dengue fever therefore deserves more attention from healthcare workers, researchers, and health policy makers. <br>	1128	227	12
Time elapsed between Zika and dengue virus infections affects antibody and T cell responses.	Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are co-endemic in many parts of the world, but the impact of ZIKV infection on subsequent DENV infection is not well understood. Here we show in rhesus macaques that the time elapsed after ZIKV infection affects the immune response to DENV infection. We show that previous ZIKV exposure increases the magnitude of the antibody and T cell responses against DENV. The time interval between ZIKV and subsequent DENV infection further affects the immune response. A mid-convalescent period of 10 months after ZIKV infection results in higher and more durable antibody and T cell responses to DENV infection than a short period of 2 months. In contrast, previous ZIKV infection does not affect DENV viremia or pro-inflammatory status. Collectively, we find no evidence of a detrimental effect of ZIKV immunity in a subsequent DENV infection. This supports the implementation of ZIKV vaccines that could also boost immunity against future DENV epidemics. <br>	839	162	8
Extensive genomic recoding by codon-pair deoptimization selective for mammals is a flexible tool to generate attenuated vaccine candidates for dengue virus 2.	The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) are the leading etiologic agent of disease caused by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) in the world, with billions at risk of DENV infection spread by infected mosquitoes. DENV causes illness ranging from dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DENV proliferates well in two different host systems, an invertebrate mosquito vector and vertebrate primate host, which have a distinct difference in their preference of codon pairs (CP) for translation (different "codon pair bias"). Consequently, arboviruses must delicately balance the use of codon pairs between mammals and arthropods, which presents an Achilles' heel that we have exploited by specifically shifting the codon pair preference in the E and NS3 ORFs away from mammals while keeping the CPB favorable for mosquito ORFs. Here we report that recoding of the ORFs has led to variants that were over-attenuated in rhesus macaques although induction of protective antibodies in animals vaccinated with the smallest recoded ORF (E) was observed. The flexibility of our synthetic vaccine design (by decreasing the number of unfavorable CPs in the E ORF), allowed us to construct two new vaccine candidates (EhminA and EhminB) with intermediate attenuation in cell culture and neonatal mice, a result demonstrating proof of concept. New DENV vaccine candidates are being developed based on selective attenuation by dramatic recoding, with flexibility in balancing the attenuation and immunogenicity by marrying rational design and empirical modification. <br>	1383	245	7
Current prevention and potential treatment options for dengue infection.	Currently, treatments for dengue infection are only symptomatic as no antiviral agents nor vaccines are available to combat this virus. Despite challenges faced by researchers, many efforts are ongoing to reduce cases of dengue infection either by targeting the vector or the virus. Vector population is monitored and reduced by using mechanical, chemical and biological controls. Chemical control is achieved either by using synthetic or natural insecticides where the latter is more preferable. In biological control, bacteria, fungi and larvivorous fish are utilised to reduce the vector population. Moreover, genes of mosquitoes are also explored to produce progenies which are sterile with low survival ability. Vaccines are among the most effective ways to prevent viral infection. Various approaches have been used and are still being explored towards producing vaccines for dengue. These include live attenuated, inactivated, recombinant subunit, nucleic acid and virus-like particles vaccines. The aim is to produce a vaccine which can target all the four serotypes of the virus. Monoclonal antibodies are widely researched on to equip the host defense mechanism against the dengue virus. Deeper understanding of the virus replication cycle warrants the development of antiviral agents which target viral proteins vital for the replication process. Bioactive compounds are also utilised in the development of antiviral agents. The importance of surveillance and supportive therapy are also discussed. <br>	1295	223	14
Inhibitory Effect of Alpha-Mangostin to Dengue Virus Replication and Cytokines Expression in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.	Massive pro-inflammatory cytokines production has been correlated with the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease. The active compound of mangosteen fruit pericarps, α-mangostin, has been commonly used as traditional medicine and dietary supplement. We examined the effect of α-mangostin against dengue virus (DENV) infection in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by the measurement of virus titer and TNF-α and IFN-γ cytokines concentration post infection. Increasing concentration of α-mangostin inhibited virus replication and reduced inflammatory cytokines expression at 24- and 48-h post infection. Our results support the potential use of α-mangostin as anti-antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies in the treatment of dengue. <br>	652	112	5
Risk factors for dengue outbreaks in Odisha, India: A case-control study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEnvironmental and climatic risk factors of dengue outbreak has been studied in detail. However, the socio-epidemiological association with the disease is least explored. The study aims to identify the social and ecological factors associated with emerging dengue in Odisha, India. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA population-based case-control study (age and sex matched at the ratio of 1:1) was conducted in six districts of the state in 2017. A structured validated questionnaire was used to collect information for each consenting participant. An ecological household survey was done using a checklist during the month of July-September. Along with the descriptive statistics, conditional logistic regression model was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio using STATA. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOf 380 cases, nearly 55% were male and the median age was 33years. The adjusted odds of having dengue was nearly three times higher among the people having occupation which demands long travel, presence of breeding sites (1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.6), presence of swampy area near home (1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.1) and having travel history close to the index date (1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.4). People staying in thatched houses had three times higher risk of the disease, however, households keeping the swampy areas clean had 50% less risk for the disease (0.5; 95% CI 0.31-0.67). Nearly 22.2% of cases had a travel history during the index date. Of them, 36% had diagnosis before the travel, whereas, 64% developed the disease after the returning from the travel. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHousehold factors such as occupation and ecological condition of households play important roles in dengue outbreaks in Odisha. However, our study suggests travel/commuting are also essential factors to be considered during disease prevention planning. <br>	1479	788	13
Molecular basis of dengue virus serotype 2 morphological switch from 29°C to 37°C.	The ability of DENV2 to display different morphologies (hence different antigenic properties) complicates vaccine and therapeutics development. Previous studies showed most strains of laboratory adapted DENV2 particles changed from smooth to "bumpy" surfaced morphology when the temperature is switched from 29°C at 37°C. Here we identified five envelope (E) protein residues different between two alternative passage history DENV2 NGC strains exhibiting smooth or bumpy surface morphologies. Several mutations performed on the smooth DENV2 infectious clone destabilized the surface, as observed by cryoEM. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated how chemically subtle substitution at various positions destabilized dimeric interactions between E proteins. In contrast, three out of four DENV2 clinical isolates showed a smooth surface morphology at 37°C, and only at high fever temperature (40°C) did they become "bumpy". These results imply vaccines should contain particles representing both morphologies. For prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, this study also informs on which types of antibodies should be used at different stages of an infection, i.e., those that bind to monomeric E proteins on the bumpy surface or across multiple E proteins on the smooth surfaced virus. <br>	1114	188	8
Antibody-Dependent Dengue Virus Entry Modulates Cell Intrinsic Responses for Enhanced Infection.	Dengue is caused by infection with any one of four dengue viruses (DENV); the risk of severe disease appears to be enhanced by the cross-reactive or subneutralizing levels of antibody from a prior DENV infection. These antibodies opsonize DENV entry through the activating Fc gamma receptors (FcγR), instead of infection through canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis, to result in higher levels of DENV replication. However, whether the enhanced replication is solely due to more efficient FcγR-mediated DENV entry or is also through FcγR-mediated alteration of the host transcriptome response to favor DENV infection remains unclear. Indeed, more efficient viral entry through activation of the FcγR can result in an increased viral antigenic load within target cells and confound direct comparisons of the host transcriptome response under antibody-dependent and antibody-independent conditions. Herein, we show that, despite controlling for the viral antigenic load in primary monocytes, the antibody-dependent and non-antibody-dependent routes of DENV entry induce transcriptome responses that are remarkably different. Notably, antibody-dependent DENV entry upregulated DENV host dependency factors associated with RNA splicing, mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, and vesicle trafficking. Additionally, supporting findings from other studies, antibody-dependent DENV entry impeded the downregulation of ribosomal genes caused by canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis to increase viral translation. Collectively, our findings support the notion that antibody-dependent DENV entry alters host responses that support the viral life cycle and that host responses to DENV need to be defined in the context of its entry pathway.IMPORTANCE Dengue virus is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral infection globally, resulting in variable manifestations ranging from asymptomatic viremia to life-threatening shock and multiorgan failure. Previous studies have indicated that the risk of severe dengue in humans can be increased by a specific range of preexisting anti-dengue virus antibody titers, a phenomenon termed antibody-dependent enhancement. There is hence a need to understand how antibodies augment dengue virus infection compared to the alternative canonical receptor-mediated viral entry route. Herein, we show that, besides facilitating viral uptake, antibody-mediated entry increases the expression of early host dependency factors to promote viral infection; these factors include RNA splicing, mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, vesicle trafficking, and ribosomal genes. These findings will enhance our understanding of how differences in entry pathways can affect host responses and offer opportunities to design therapeutics that can specifically inhibit antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection. <br>	2472	404	12
Anti-viral activity of culinary and medicinal mushroom extracts against dengue virus serotype 2: an in-vitro study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that has become a major public health concern worldwide. Presently, there is no specific vaccine or treatment available for dengue viral infection. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLignosus rhinocerotis, Pleurotus giganteus, Hericium erinaceus, Schizophyllum commune and Ganoderma lucidium were selected for evaluation of their in-vitro anti-dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) activities. Hot aqueous extracts (HAEs), ethanol extracts (EEs), hexane soluble extracts (HSEs), ethyl acetate soluble extracts (ESEs) and aqueous soluble extracts (ASEs) were prepared from the selected mushrooms. The cytotoxic effects of the extracts were evaluated by the MTT assay. The anti-DENV-2 activities of the extracts were evaluated in three different assays: simultaneous, attachment and penetration assays were perfomed using plaque reduction assays and RT-qPCR assays. The effect of the addition time on viral replication was assessed by the time of addition assay, and a virucidal assay was carried out to evaluate the direct effect of each mushroom extract on DENV-2. The chemical composition of glucans, and the protein and phenolic acid contents in the extracts were estimated. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe found that the HAEs and ASEs of L. rhinocerotis, P. giganteus, H. erinaceus and S. commune were the least toxic to Vero cells and showed very prominent anti-DENV2 activity. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of the ASEs ranged between 399.2-637.9 μg/ml, while for the HAEs the range was 312.9-680.6 μg/ml during simultaneous treatment. Significant anti-dengue activity was also detected in the penetration assay of ASEs (IC50: 226.3-315.4 μg/ml) and HAEs (IC50: 943.1-2080.2 μg/ml). Similarly, we observed a marked reduction in the expression levels of the ENV and NS5 genes in the simultaneous and penetration assays of the ASEs and HAEs. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the highest percent of anti-DENV2 activity was observed when the mushroom extracts were added immediately after virus adsorption. None of the extracts exhibited virucidal effect. Chemical composition analysis showed that the major components in the mushroom HAEs and ASEs were glucan (beta D-glucan) and proteins, however, there was no significant correlation between the anti-dengue activity and the concentration of glucans and proteins. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese findings demonstrated the potential of mushroom extracts as anti-dengue therapeutic agents with less toxic effects. <br>	2089	1043	20
Increase of Plasma TNF-α Is Associated with Decreased Levels of Blood Platelets in Clinical Dengue Infection.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection has become an increasingly common concern in tropical and subtropical regions. It has protean manifestations ranging from febrile phase to severe life-threatening illness. In this study, we estimated Th1 and Th2 cytokines and correlated the levels with dengue severity along with certain hematological and biochemical parameters. We also studied the seroprevalence of dengue between October and December 2017 at the Government Theni Medical College, India. Individuals with dengue fever (DF) were positive for either IgM or IgG, or both. The biochemical and hematological parameters along with plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-13, IL-12p70, IL-10, IL-5, IL-4, and IL-2 cytokines were estimated. The prevalence of DF was 42.9% during the study period. IL-2, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-10 levels were significantly elevated (p < 0.005) in patients with secondary DENV infection, whereas the level of IL-13 remained unaltered during both primary and secondary infections. No statistically significant difference was noticed with IL-12p70, IL-5, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF between the healthy controls and the primary and secondary DENV-infected groups. Increase of 1 unit of TNF-α was associated with a decrease of 160 units of blood platelets. Together, the study suggests that TNF-α could play a key role in the pathogenesis of dengue, and despite the decrease in platelet levels, it remains to be seen whether any other inflammatory cells regulate the levels of TNF-α in DENV infection. <br>	1381	264	11
Oxidative stress response in the pathogenesis of dengue virus virulence, disease prognosis and therapeutics: an update.	Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that causes febrile illness and can lead to a potentially lethal disease. The mechanism of disease pathogenesis is not completely understood, and there are currently no vaccines or therapeutic drugs available to protect against all four serotypes of DENV. Although many reasons have been suggested for the development of the disease, dengue studies have shown that, during DENV infection, there is an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants that disrupts homeostasis. An increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels triggers the sudden release of cytokines, which can lead to plasma leakage and other severe symptoms. In the present review, we give an overview of the oxidative stress response and its effect on the progression of dengue disease. We also discuss the role of oxidative-stress-associated molecules in disease prognostic and therapeutics. <br>	780	141	6
Validation of educational booklet: an educational technology in dengue prevention.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto validate a booklet on dengue prevention in order to make it an educational technology to be used with the population. <br><b>METHOD:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmethodological study, carried out with two groups of judges specialized in health and other areas. For data analysis, the calculation of Content Validity Index was carried out. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe booklet, in general, was considered valid by the expert judges, since it obtained an overall CVI of 70%. However, it has undergone a textual and aesthetic re-elaboration. The changes were based on the substitution of expressions, phrases, information additions and language adequacy. The illustrations were redone, adding clarity, expressiveness, movement, interaction and contextualization. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe booklet is valid to be used for the population, with the purpose of informing, in a playful way, the forms of prevention and combat to mosquito transmitting dengue. <br>	736	388	8
[Seasonality of dengue reporting in state capitals in the Brazilian Amazon and impacts of El Niño/La Niña].	The dynamics of dengue transmission are multifactorial and involve socioeconomic, ecological, and environmental aspects, the latter being closely related to local climatic conditions that affect the vector's reproductive cycle. Climate depends in turn on tropical oceanic mechanisms such as phases of El Niño/La Niña over the Pacific. The study contributes to this discussion and reports on the correlations between the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) in the Pacific and the number of reported dengue cases in seven state capitals in the Brazilian Amazon from 2001 to 2012. The study also analyzes the seasonality pattern (quarterly mean values) in dengue cases throughout the region. Evidence that El Niño/La Niña causes a decrease versus increase in the local rainfall pattern is consistent with the lower versus higher number of reported dengue cases in most of the state capitals in the Amazon, a result proven by the statistically significant negative correlations seen in Manaus (Amazonas), São Luís (Maranhão), Belém (Pará) and Palmas (Tocantins). The 12-years means (2001-2012) revealed the presence of pronounced seasonality in dengue incidence in the majority of the state capitals, with sharp peaks from January to March [Rio Branco (Acre), Manaus, Belém and Palmas] and from April to June (São Luís), corresponding to 50-70% of the annual total. State capitals farther north [Boa Vista (Roraima) and Macapá (Amapá)] showed dengue reporting in all quarters of the year, with no pronounced seasonality. <br>	1286	238	6
A Rare Presentation of Coinfection: Dengue Virus and Hepatitis A Virus.	Dengue fever caused by dengue virus is a common tropical infection transmitted by the mosquitos Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Four strains of the genus flavivirus is responsible for the epidemics of varying severity. Hepatitis A caused by hepatitis A virus is spread by faecal-oral route. The culprit virus is a hepatovirus. Coinfection with dengue virus and hepatitis A virus is rare and is a diagnostic as well as management challenge to the medical professional. We report a patient who presented to us with dengue virus and hepatitis A virus coinfection. <br>	479	94	6
Detection of dengue using PAMAM dendrimer integrated tapered optical fiber sensor.	The exponential escalation of dengue cases has indeed become a global health crisis. This work elaborates on the development of a biofunctionalized tapered optical fiber (TOF) based sensor with the integration of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer for the detection of dengue E protein. The dimension of the TOF generated an evanescent field that was sensitive to any changes in the external medium while the integration of PAMAM promoted more adhesion of bio-recognition molecules; anti-DENV II E protein antibodies; that were complementary to the targeted protein. This in return created more active sites for the absorption of DENV II E proteins onto the tapered region. The resolution and detection limit of the sensor are 19.53 nm/nM and 1 pM, respectively with Kd = 1.02 × 10-10 M. <br>	666	131	5
Selective Detection of Dengue Virus Serotypes Using Tandem Toehold-Mediated Displacement Reactions.	Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common human arboviral infection worldwide and can present with severe clinical manifestations. Timely DENV detection improves clinical outcomes, and identification of the DENV serotype (DENV-1-4) may provide beneficial epidemiologic data to inform the initiation of control measures. Here, DENV RNA-triggered, enzyme-free tandem toehold-mediated displacement reactions were developed to identify and serotype DENV in RNA controls and contrived samples through the amplification of a fluorescent signal detected by the use of a fluorescent scanner and a confocal microscope. Each DENV serotype was detected selectively using both imaging methods. In addition, a 384-well plate was used to prepare an array for diagnosis of the four DENV RNA serotypes from contrived clinical samples. The four serotypes of dengue virus were detected using novel enzyme-free amplification reactions, which are more facile than amplification using reverse transcriptase PCR. <br>	854	148	6
Post-infectious functional gastrointestinal disorders in children after a non-severe dengue episode without warning signs	Introduction: The pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders involves infectious agents such as viruses. Objective: To study the development of functional gastrointestinal disorders 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after an episode of non-severe dengue without warning signs in children. Materials and methods: We conducted a cohort study in 73 children diagnosed with non-severe dengue without warning signs at Hospital Universitario del Valle “Evaristo García” and 62 healthy children from Cali, Colombia. Using the Questionnaire for Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rome III (QPGS-III) in Spanish we identified functional gastrointestinal disorders 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after non-severe dengue without warning signs. Measurements of central tendency, relative risk, chi square, and Fisher’s exact test were performed, with p<0.05 being significant. Results: We included 135 children who were 10.7±1.9 years old; 51.1% of them were male and 19.3% had a functional gastrointestinal disorder (9.6% of them had abdominal pain related to functional gastrointestinal disorders). There was a greater risk to present a functional gastrointestinal disorder and related abdominal pain in children after non-severe dengue without warning signs at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of follow-up, but without significant differences. Conclusion: Our study suggests that non-severe dengue without warning signs does not increase the risk of functional gastrointestinal disorders and related abdominal pain for up to 12 months of follow-up. <br>	1311	236	8

Host serum iron modulates dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes.	A blood meal is the primary route through which mosquitoes acquire an arbovirus infection. Blood components or their metabolites may regulate the susceptibility of mosquitoes to arboviruses. Here we report that serum iron in human blood influences dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes. Dengue virus acquisition by Aedes aegypti was inversely correlated with the iron concentration in serum from human donors. In a mouse-mosquito acquisition model, iron supplementation reduced dengue virus prevalence and viral load, whereas neutralization of serum iron facilitated dengue virus infection in A. aegypti mosquitoes. Of note, mosquitoes feeding on iron-deficient (sideropenic) mice exhibited a higher prevalence of dengue virus. Reversal of the sideropenic status of hosts largely reduced dengue virus acquisition and infection by mosquitoes. Serum iron, rather than haem-bound iron, was utilized by the mosquito iron metabolism pathway to boost the activity of reactive oxygen species in the gut epithelium, subsequently inhibiting infection by dengue virus. On the basis of these results, a status of iron deficiency in the human population might contribute to the vectorial permissiveness to dengue virus, thereby facilitating its spread by mosquitoes. <br>	1081	185	10
High levels of serum hyaluronan is an early predictor of dengue warning signs and perturbs vascular integrity.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA main pathological feature of severe dengue virus infection is endothelial hyper-permeability. The dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been implicated in the vascular leakage that characterizes severe dengue virus infection, however, the molecular mechanisms involved are not known. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cohort of 250 dengue patients has been followed from the onset of symptoms to the recovery phase. Serum hyaluronan levels and several other clinical parameters were recorded. The effect of NS1 treatment of cultured fibroblasts and endothelial cells on the expressions of hyaluronan synthetic and catabolic enzymes and the hyaluronan receptor CD44, were determined, as have the effects on the formation of hyaluronan-rich matrices and endothelial permeability. <br><b>FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspElevated serum hyaluronan levels (≥70 ng/ml) during early infection was found to be an independent predictor for occurrence of warning signs, and thus severe dengue fever. High circulating levels of the viral protein NS1, indicative of disease severity, correlated with high concentrations of serum hyaluronan. NS1 exposure decreased the expression of CD44 in differentiating endothelial cells impairing the integrity of vessel-like structures, and promoted the synthesis of hyaluronan in dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells in synergy with dengue-induced pro-inflammatory mediators. Deposited hyaluronan-rich matrices around cells cultured in vitro recruited CD44-expressing macrophage-like cells, suggesting a mechanism for enhancement of inflammation. In cultured endothelial cells, perturbed hyaluronan-CD44 interactions enhanced endothelial permeability through modulation of VE-cadherin and cytoskeleton re-organization, and exacerbated the NS1-induced disruption of endothelial integrity. <br><b>INTERPRETATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPharmacological targeting of hyaluronan biosynthesis and/or its CD44-mediated signaling may limit the life-threatening vascular leakiness during moderate-to-severe dengue virus infection.

Increased serum sialic acid is associated with morbidity and mortality in a murine model of dengue disease.	Dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent arboviral infection of humans, resulting in a spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infection to dengue fever to severe dengue characterized by vascular leakage and shock. Previously, we determined that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) induces endothelial hyperpermeability, disrupts the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) in vitro and triggers shedding of structural components, including sialic acid (Sia) and heparan sulfate. Here, using a murine model of dengue disease disease, we found high levels of Sia and NS1 circulating in mice with DENV-induced morbidity and lethal DENV infection. Further, we developed a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based method for quantifying free Sia in serum and determined that the levels of free N-glycolylneuraminic acid were significantly higher in DENV-infected mice than in uninfected controls. These data provide additional evidence that DENV infection disrupts EGL components in vivo and warrant further research assessing Sia as a biomarker of severe dengue disease. <br>	933	159	5

Fast emerging insecticide resistance in Aedes albopictus in Guangzhou, China: Alarm to the dengue epidemic.	Dengue is one of the most serious mosquito-borne infectious diseases in the world. Aedes albopictus is the most invasive mosquito and one of the primary vectors of dengue. Vector control using insecticides is the only viable strategy to prevent dengue virus transmission. In Guangzhou, after the 2014 pandemic, massive insecticides have been implemented. Massive insecticide use may lead to the development of resistance, but few reports are available on the status of insecticide resistance in Guangzhou after 2014. In this study, Ae. albopictus were collected from four districts with varied dengue virus transmission intensity in Guangzhou from 2015 to 2017. Adult Ae. albopictus insecticide susceptibility to deltamethrin (0.03%), permethrin(0.25%), DDT(4%), malathion (0.8%) and bendiocarb (0.1%) was determined by the standard WHO tube test, and larval resistance bioassays were conducted using temephos, Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), pyriproxyfen (PPF) and hexaflumuron. Mutations at the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene were analyzed. The effect of cytochrome P450s on the resistance of Ae. albopictus to deltamethrin was tested using the synergistic agent piperonyl butoxide (PBO). The results showed that Ae. albopictus populations have rapidly developed very high resistances to multiple commonly used insecticides at all study areas except malathion, Bti and hexaflumuron. We found 1534 codon mutations in the VGSC gene that were significantly correlated with the resistance to pyrethroids and DDT, and 11 synonymous mutations were also found in the gene. The resistance to deltamethrin can be significantly reduced by PBO but may generated cross-resistance to PPF. Fast emerging resistance in Ae. albopictus may affect mosquito management and threaten the prevention and control of dengue, similar to the resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes has prevented the elimination of malaria and call for timely and guided insecticide management. <br>	1724	298	16
Prevalence and laboratory analysis of malaria and dengue co-infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA clear understanding of the epidemiology of malaria and dengue co-infection is essential for informed decisions on appropriate control strategies for dengue and malaria. This systematic review synthesized evidence on the relationship of malaria and dengue co-infection and related it to alterations in platelet, hemoglobin, hematocrit, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels when compared to malaria mono-infection. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines was conducted. All published articles available in PubMed and Web of Science (ISI) databases before October 21, 2017 were recruited. All epidemiological studies except case reports on the prevalence or incidence of malaria and dengue co-infection among patients visiting hospitals with febrile illness were included. Studies that involved conference abstracts, protocols, systematic reviews, only mono-dengue or mono-malaria infections, and only animal or in vitro studies were excluded after screening the titles, abstracts, and body texts. Studies were additionally excluded after full text review when they lacked epidemiologic data on malaria and dengue co-infection. Two reviewers independently screened, reviewed, and assessed all the studies. Cochrane Q (Chi-square) and Moran's I2 were used to assess heterogeneity, and the funnel plot was used to examine publication bias. The summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a fixed-effects model. Thirteen cross-sectional and two retrospective studies were eligible to be included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOut of the 2269 citations screened, 15 articles were eligible to be included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The 15 studies involved 13,798 (10,373 cases with malaria and 3425 with dengue) patients in 9 countries. Thirteen studies compared the incidence and odds of Plasmodium sp. infection, five studies compared the odds of mean platelet, three studies compared Plasmodium parasite density, and four studies compared the odds of hemoglobin, hematocrit, AST, and ALT levels among co-infected groups and single-malaria-infected groups. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study showed that dengue and malaria co-infection was associated with decreased odds of malaria infection, malaria parasitemia, AST, and ALT levels when compared to malaria mono-infection. However, malaria and dengue co-infection was associated with increased odds of platelet and hemoglobin levels when compared to malaria mono-infection. <br>	2173	1077	17
A clinical and epidemiological survey of the largest dengue outbreak in Southern Taiwan in 2015.	<b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study examined the epidemiological, clinical and immunological characteristics of the 2015 dengue outbreak in Taiwan. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClinical data were collected from dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients. Phylogenetic tree was used to analyze the outbreak strain source. Paired plasma from DF/DHF patients were used for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay and cytokine multiplex biometric immunoassay to validate the immunological mechanism. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis outbreak mainly occurred in two of the southern cities of Taiwan; Tainan(22,777; 52%) and Kaohsiung (19,784; 45%). High DHF death rate (34.6%) was noticed. Case (DHF) and control (DF) study indicated that older age (>60yrs), type II diabetes and hypertension are risk factors correlated with DHF development (p < 0.0001). Phylogenetic tree results suggest that the outbreak-associated strain was dengue serotype 2 and cosmopolitan genotype, forming a stable cluster with the isolates from Thailand and Indonesia (bootstrap value of 99%). Cytokine analyses demonstrated that levels of IL-6, IL-4, IL-13, IL-1β, INF-γ and GM-CSF are significantly higher in DHF compared to DF patients (p < 0.001). ADE assay shows that diluted plasma containing preexisting dengue antibodies from DHF patients significantly enhanced dengue infection (p < 0.05). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe results suggests that older age, type II diabetes, hypertension, immunological cytokine dysregulation, as well as preexisting dengue antibodies inducing ADE infection are correlated with dengue severity. This study also indicates that the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan might have been a result of imported DF from dengue epidemic regions. <br>	1425	616	12
Glycyrrhizic acid derivatives as Dengue virus inhibitors.	Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most geographically distributed pathogenic flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitoes Aedes sps. In this study, the structure-antiviral activity relationships of Glycyrrhizic acid (GL) derivatives was evaluated by the inhibitory assays on the cytopathic effect (CPE) and viral infectivity of DENV type 2 (DENV2) in Vero E6 cells. GL (96% purity) had a low cytotoxicity to Vero E6 cells, inhibited DENV2-induced CPE, and reduced the DENV-2 infectivity with the IC50 of 8.1 μM. Conjugation of GL with amino acids or their methyl esters and the introduction of aromatic acylhydrazide residues into the carbohydrate part strongly influenced on the antiviral activity. Among compounds tested GL conjugates with isoleucine 13 and 11-aminoundecanoic acid 17 were found as potent anti-DENV2 inhibitors (IC50 1.2-1.3 μM). Therefore, modification of GL is a perspective way in the search of new antivirals against DENV2 infection. <br>	814	153	6
Toxic effect of essential oil and its compounds isolated from Sphaeranthus amaranthoides Burm. f. against dengue mosquito vector Aedes aegypti Linn.	Aedes aegypti is a major mosquito vector that can transfer many deadly diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever viruses. Due to the developing resistance among the vector populations by the application of chemical insecticides, alternative eco-friendly vector management strategies are being focused. In this aspect, the present study was carried out to evaluate the mosquitocidal potentials of essential oil of Sphaeranthus amaranthoides (EO-Sa). EO-Sa was found to be effective against Ae. aegypti mosquito vector by exhibiting significant larvicidal, adulticidal and repellent activities. GCMS analysis of EO-Sa revealed the presence of Carvone as the major component (peak area of 89.7%). The larvicidal bioassays performed revealed that the second instar larvae were relatively more susceptible (94.32% mortality) to EO-Sa treatments (75 ppm), LC50, 20.38 ppm.The sub lethal treatment concentration (20 ppm) significantly affected the oviposition, fecundity and morphology of Ae. aegypti. At sub lethal treatment concentration, EO-Sa down regulated α- and β carboxylesterase and up regulated the GST and CYP450 level of third and fourth instar larvae. Thus the present results illustrates that EO-Sa can deliver a durable larvicidal, repellent and adulticidal activity against Ae. aegypti in an effective and eco-friendly manner. <br>	1167	207	11

Chemical composition of the essential oil and n-hexane extract of Stachys tmolea subsp. Tmolea Boiss., an endemic species of Turkey, and their mosquitocidal activity against dengue vector Aesdes aegypti.	Stachys tmolea subsp. tmolea Boiss. is endemic to Turkey and is a species of the genus Stachys L. which is one of the largest genera of the family Lamiaceae with about 300 species. The aims of this study were to examine the chemical composition of the essential oil and n-hexane extract of S. tmolea subsp. tmolea as natural sources of insecticidal activity against the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. Analysis of the essential oil by GC-FID and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) systems identified hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (15%), viridiflorol (10%), hexadecanoic acid (7%) and 9-geranyl-p-cymene (6%) as major components. The volatile components of the n-hexane extract were extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and were analyzed using GC-MS. The principal constituents were 3,4-dimethyl decane (16%), 3-methyl-3-pentanol (15%), 2-methyl-2-pentanol (12%), 1,4-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl) benzene (12%), heptanal (10%), acetic acid (6%) and decane (4%). Bioassay of the n-hexane extract, at 5 µg/mosquito, produced 90% mortality against adult Ae. aegypti while the S. tmolea essential oil demonstrated 13% mortality. No larvicidal activity was observed both in essential oil and n-hexane extract. Further studies are needed to assess the adulticidal activity of the responsible compounds in the crude extract. <br>	1157	219	15
Updated recommendations of the International Dengue Initiative expert group for CYD-TDV vaccine implementation in Latin America.	Dengue disease represents a large and growing global threat to public health, causing a significant burden to health systems of endemic countries. For countries considering vaccination as part of their Integrated Management Strategy for Prevention and Control of Dengue, the World Health Organization currently recommends the first licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV for: individuals aged 9 years or above from populations with high transmission rates, based on either seroprevalence criteria or pre-vaccination screening strategies, and for persons with confirmed prior exposure to infection in moderate to lower transmission settings. This paper describes the main conclusions of the Sixth Meeting of the International Dengue Initiative (IDI) held in June 2018, following release of a new product label by the manufacturer, updated WHO-SAGE recommendations, additional scientific evidence on vaccine performance, and reports of experiences by implementing countries. Considerations were made regarding the need for improving the quality of epidemiological and surveillance data in the region to help define the convenience of either of the two vaccination strategies recommended by WHO-SAGE. Extensive discussion was dedicated to the pros and cons of implementing either of such strategies in Latin America. Although, in general, a seroprevalence-based approach was preferred in high transmission settings, when cost-effectivity is favorable pre-vaccination screening is a convenient alternative. Cost-effectiveness evaluations can assist with the decisions by public health authorities of whether to introduce a vaccine. Where implemented, vaccine introduction should be part of a public health strategy that includes the participation of multiple sectors of society, incorporating input from scientific societies, ministries of heath, and civil society, while ensuring a robust communication program. <br>	1646	272	8
Evaluating the suitability of RNA intervention mechanism exerted by some flavonoid molecules against dengue virus MTase RNA capping site: a molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy study.	Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne human pathogens known to the mankind. Currently, no vaccines or standard therapy is avaliable to treate DENV infection. This makes the drug development against DENV more significant and challenging. The MTase domain of DENV RNA RdRp NS5 is a promising drug target, because this domain hosts the RNA capping process of DENV RNA to escape from human immune system. In the present study, we have analysed the RNA intervention mechanism exerted by flavoniod molecules against NS5 MTase RNA capping site by using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and the binding free energy calculations. The results from the docking analysis confirmed that the RNA intervention mecanism is exerted by the quercetagetin (QGN) molecule with all necessary intermolecular interactions and high binding affinity. Notably, QGN forms strong hydrogen bonding interactions with Asn18, Leu20 and Ser150 residues and π⋅⋅⋅π stacking interaction with Phe25 residue. The apo and QGN bound NS5 MTase and QGN-NS5 MTase complex were used for MD simulation. The results of MD simulation reveal that the RMSD and RMSF values of QGN-MTase complex have increased on comparing the apo protein due to the effect of ligand binding. The binding free energy calulation includes prediction of total binding free energy of ligand-protein complex and per-residue free energy decomposition. The QGN binding to NS5 MTase affects it's native motion, this result is found from Principal component analysis. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma. <br>	1335	248	13

Human parvovirus B19 genotype 1 in suspected dengue patients of Tefé, Amazonas State, Brazil.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHuman parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a common pathogen, which on infection causes variety of clinical conditions from benign self-limiting exanthematous disease and other similar pathologies to fetal death. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe collected 341 serum samples between the first and fourth day after the onset of symptoms from all patients suspected of dengue fever who were attended at Regional Hospital of Tefé. Initially, patients were screened for malaria by blood smear test and negative samples were sent to Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) situated in Manaus (AM) for dengue testing using semi-nested multiplex PCR. Further, we investigated 44 malaria and dengue-negative samples of children for B19V DNA by nested-PCR. Positive samples were analyzed by BLAST against entire public non-redundant nucleotide database and genotyped by phylogenetic analyses using neighbor-joining clustering method. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEight samples (18.2%) were found to be PCR positive. Fever, headache, ocular pain, and/or muscle pain were reported as the most frequent symptoms by the patients and none were diagnosed with rash at the time of sample collection. Phylogenetic analysis of major capsid protein 2 (VP2) and VP3 coding region showed high similarity with B19V genotype 1. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur results reveal the spread of B19V genotype 1 in Tefé. Moreover, our results emphasize the significance of laboratorial differential diagnosis using molecular techniques in patients with acute febrile, and thereby aid the health surveillance system in improving patient care even in the remote areas of Amazon. <br>	1345	692	10
Prevalence of self-reported dengue infections in Manaus Metropolitan Region: a cross-sectional study.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is an endemic and epidemic disease in Brazil, with a high burden of disease. Amazonas State has a high risk of transmission. This study aimed to assess the self-reported prevalence of dengue in adults living in Manaus Metropolitan Region. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cross-sectional study was conducted with adults living in Manaus Metropolitan Region in 2015. We performed a three-phase probabilistic sampling to collect participants' clinical and sociodemographic data. Self-reported dengue infection in the previous year was the primary outcome. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression analysis with robust variance were used to calculate the prevalence ratio (PR) of dengue infections with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Multilevel analysis including city and neighborhood variables was calculated. All analyses considered the complex sampling. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAmong the 4,001 participants, dengue in the previous year was self-reported by 7.0% (95% CI 6.3%-7.8%). Dengue was more frequent in women(PR 1.51; 95% CI 1.06-2.13), elderly participants (≥60 years old, PR 2.54; 95% CI 1.19-5.45), White and Asian participants (PR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.11-2.23), and individuals who had not received endemic agent visits (PR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.31-3.99). After multilevel analysis, sex was no longer a significant variable, with the remaining associations still significant. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeven out of 100 inhabitants of Manaus Metropolitan Region reported dengue in the previous year. Dengue was predominantly observed in women, elderly individuals, White and Asian individuals, and individuals who did not receive endemic agent visits. The setting plays an important role in dengue infections. <br>	1413	735	14

Can Complementary Prime-Boost Immunization Strategies Be an Alternative and Promising Vaccine Approach Against Dengue Virus?	Dengue is one of the most important diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. Dengvaxia®, a vaccine registered in several countries, cannot be administered to non-immune individuals and children younger than 9 years old, due to safety reasons. There are two vaccine candidates in phase 3 efficacy trials, but their registration date is completely unknown at this moment. So, the development of new vaccines or vaccine strategies continues to be a priority for the WHO. This work reviews some complementary prime-boost immunization studies against important human pathogens. Additionally, it reviews the results obtained using this regimen of immunization against dengue virus as a potential alternative approach for finding a safe and efficient vaccine. Finally, the main elements associated with this strategy are also discussed. The generation of new strategies of vaccination against dengue virus, must be directed to reduce the risk of increasing viral load through sub-neutralizing antibodies and it must be also directed to induce a polyfunctional T cell response. Complementary prime-boost immunization strategies could emerge as an interesting approach to induce solid immunity or at least to reduce viral load after natural infection, avoiding severe dengue. Subunit vaccine could be safe and attractive antigens for this strategy, especially proteins including B, and T-cells epitopes for inducing humoral and cellular immune responses, which can play an important role controlling the disease. <br>	1285	226	10
Secondary dengue infection in immunocompetent murine model leads to heart tissue damage.	Dengue, considered the most important arthropod-borne viral disease affecting humans, is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and caused by one of the four distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4). Infection with one of the four serotypes provides lifelong homotypic immunity. However, immunity against the heterologous serotypes is transient. As a consequence, secondary infection may lead to severer manifestations due to cross-reactivity of antibodies and T-cells. Over 500,000 people are hospitalized every year and around 2,5 million, living in endemic areas, are at risk of infection. Given the background, the development of vaccines and anti-DENV drugs is of the utmost importance, as is the characterization of an animal model for testing them. The purpose of this study was to investigate ultrastructural alterations caused by DENV secondary infection in BALB/c mice heart. To achieve our goal, six BALB/c mice were infected with DENV-1 and, 4 months later, reinfected with DENV-2. Uninfected mice were used as negative controls. Heart samples were collected and processed for ultrastructural and histopathological analysis. Our results showed edema, endothelium activation characterized by the presence of transport vesicles, free platelets in interstitium, mitochondria presenting rarefied matrix and degenerated cristae, and disorganization of muscle fibers. These results point not only to BALB/c mice susceptibility to DENV infection, but also to the fact that, although it is not an often reported occurrence, dengue can lead to heart damage. Keywords: dengue; experimental model; reinfection; BALB/c mice. <br>	1423	258	13
Synthetic peptide optimization improves the inhibition of dengue NS2B-NS3 protease and dengue replication in vitro.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the most widely-spread flavivirus infections with no effective antiviral drugs available. Peptide inhibitors have been considered as one of the best drug candidates due to their high specificity, selectivity in their interactions and minimum side effects. In this study, we employed computational studies using YASARA, HADDOCK server and PyMOL software to generate short and linear peptides based on a reference peptide, CP5-46A, to block DENV NS2B-NS3 protease. The inhibition potencies of the peptides were evaluated using in-house DENV2 serine protease and fluorogenic peptide substrates. In vitro analyses were performed to determine the peptides cytotoxicity and the inhibitory effects against DENV2 replication in WRL-68 cells. Our computational analyses revealed that the docking energy of AYA3, a 16 amino acid (aa) (-81.2 ± 10.6 kcal/mol) and AYA9, a 15 aa peptide (-83.8 ± 6.8 kcal/mol) to DENV NS2B-NS3 protease were much lower than the reference peptide (46 aa; -70.9 ± 7.8 kcal/mol) and the standard protease inhibitor, aprotinin (58 aa; -48.2 ± 10.6 kcal/mol). Both peptides showed significant inhibition against DENV2 NS2B-NS3 protease activity with IC50 values of 24 µM and 23 µM, respectively. AYA3 and AYA9 peptides also demonstrated approximately 68% and 83% of viral plaque reduction without significantly affecting cell viability at 50 µM concentration. In short, we generated short linear peptides with lower cytotoxic effect and substantial antiviral activities against DENV2. Further studies are required to investigate the inhibitory effects of these peptides in vivo. Keywords: peptide inhibitors; dengue virus; NS2B-NS3 protease; plaque reduction. <br>	1468	270	11
Serum LPS Associated with Hantavirus and Dengue Disease Severity in Barbados.	Hantavirus and dengue virus (DENV) infections are caused by RNA viruses which infect immune systems' cells including monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells and occur year-round in Barbados. A retrospective serological study (2008-2015) was conducted on hantavirus and dengue patient sera confirmed by IgM and IgG ELISA, NS1 and RT-PCR using Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) kinetic turbidimetric method to determine serum endotoxin levels. Hantavirus patients were categorized into two groups, namely (a) hospitalized and (b) non-hospitalized. Dengue patients were categorized into 3 groups using 2009 WHO dengue guidelines (a) severe dengue (SD), (b) hospitalized non-severe dengue (non-SD) and (c) non-hospitalized non-SD. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the association of endotoxin levels with hantavirus disease severity based on hospitalization and dengue disease severity. Serum endotoxin levels are associated with hantavirus disease severity and hospitalization and dengue disease severity (p < 0.01). Similar studies have found an association of serum endotoxin levels with dengue disease severity but never with hantavirus infection. Co-detection of hantavirus- and DENV-specific IgM in some patients were observed with elevated serum endotoxin levels. In addition, previous studies observed hantavirus replication in the gut of patients, gastrointestinal tract as a possible entry route of infection and evidence of microbial translocation and its impact on hantavirus disease severity. A significant correlation of serum endotoxin and hantavirus disease severity and hospitalization in hantavirus infected patients is reported for the first time ever. In addition, serum endotoxin levels correlated with dengue disease severity. This study adds further support to the role of endotoxin in both hantavirus and dengue virus infection and disease severity and its role as a possible therapeutic target for viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs). <br>	1701	286	12
Lessons Learned from Dengue Surveillance and Research, Puerto Rico, 1899-2013.	Dengue was first reported in Puerto Rico in 1899 and sporadically thereafter. Following outbreaks in 1963 and 1969, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has worked closely with the Puerto Rico Department of Health to monitor and reduce the public health burden of dengue. During that time, evolving epidemiologic scenarios have provided opportunities to establish, improve, and expand disease surveillance and interventional research projects. These initiatives have enriched the tools available to the global public health community to understand and combat dengue, including diagnostic tests, methods for disease and vector surveillance, and vector control techniques. Our review serves as a guide to organizations seeking to establish dengue surveillance and research programs by highlighting accomplishments, challenges, and lessons learned during more than a century of dengue surveillance and research conducted in Puerto Rico. <br>	816	135	5
Differences in the Transmission of Dengue Fever by Different Serotypes of Dengue Virus.	Dengue fever is the most common arbovirus in the world, and all four serotypes are infectious and pathogenic, but dengue virus (DENV)-1 and DENV-2 are the most prevalent in Guangdong Province. To investigate the differences in serotypes, we evaluated the replication, pathogenicity, and NS1 expression of DENV-2 and DENV-3 in cells, and further investigated the effects of NS1 on viral replication and transmission. The results of this study indicated that DENV-2 replicated faster and was more pathogenic than DENV-3. In Vero cells, DENV-2 secreted more NS1 protein than DENV-3, and NS1 protein promoted the infection of Aedes albopictus and A. aegypti by DENV. The spread of DENV and the severity of the disease depend on many factors. Further research on the differences between different serotypes of DENV will help us understand the epidemiology of DENV infection. This will provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of the dengue epidemic. <br>	816	161	8
Ocular manifestations of dengue.	<b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are an increasing number of publications related to dengue ophthalmic manifestations and multimodality imaging related to dengue. This review summarizes the current literature, describe ocular manifestations, current using of ocular imaging/investigations, and management of ocular dengue. <br><b>RECENT FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOcular manifestations of dengue can be present in many stages of dengue fever including after the resolution of systemic disease. Most cases of ocular dengue will exhibit an improvement in vision spontaneously over time. Multimodal imaging such as optical coherence tomography, optical coherence tomography angiography, near-infrared imaging, and microperimetry plays an important role in the diagnosis, follow-up, quantitative measure, and help to understand the disease progression. <br><b>SUMMARY:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever can lead to a variety of ocular manifestations. The mechanisms underlying dengue-related ocular complications remain unclear. Immune-mediated mechanisms and direct viral invasion are thought to play an important role. Ophthalmologists should carefully assess patients with dengue-related ophthalmic disease because some patients may have poor visual acuity and exhibit refractoriness to treatment. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids may benefit those patients with poor presenting visual acuity, progressive ocular symptoms, and lesions involving the optic nerve and/or threatening the macula. <br>	1214	392	10
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy (PRES) in a Child with Severe Dengue.	Among neurological complications associated with dengue, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has not been reported in pediatric population. We report a 10-year-old girl with severe dengue who developed PRES. The patient presented with hemorrhagic shock that required fluid resuscitation and inotropic support. She developed seizures with encephalopathy 2 days after recovering from the shock. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was negative for dengue (no white blood cells in CSF with negative polymerase chain reaction for dengue). Her clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings showed typical changes associated with posterior encephalopathy that reverted after resolution of hypertension. Repeat MRI after a month was normal. PRES should be considered as a possible differential diagnoses of dengue associated encephalopathy, especially in cases with normal CSF examination and characteristic MRI changes. <br>	827	132	8
Analyzing the control of dengue by releasing Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes through a delay differential equation model.	To date, an innovative strategy to control dengue is to release Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes into wild areas to sterilize wild female mosquito vectors by cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). To investigate the efficacy of Wolbachia in blocking dengue virus transmission, we develop a deterministic mathematical model of human and mosquito populations in which one dengue serotype circulates. The delay differential equation model captures the respective extrinsic and intrinsic incu-bation periods (EIP and IIP) in the mosquito and human, as well as the maturation delay between mating and emergence of adult mosquitoes, which have received relatively little attention. We analyze the existence and stability of disease-free equilibria, and obtain a sufficient and necessary condition on the existence of the disease-endemic equilibrium. We also determine two threshold values of the release ratio $\theta$, denoted by $\theta_1^*$ and $\theta_2^*$ with $\theta_1^*>\theta_2^*$. When $\theta>\theta_1^*$, the mosquito population will be eradicated eventually. When $\theta_2^*<\theta < \theta_1^*$, a complete mosquito eradication becomes impossible, but virus eradication is ensured at the meantime. When $\theta<\theta_2^*$, the disease-endemic equilibrium emerges that allows dengue virus to circulate between humans and mosquitoes. We carry out sensitivity analysis of the threshold values in terms of the model parameters, and simulate several possible control strate-gies with different release ratios, which confirm the public awareness that reducing mosquito bites and killing adult mosquitoes are the most effective strategy to control the epidemic. Our model provides new insights on the effectiveness of Wolbachia in reducing dengue at a population level. <br>	1532	254	10
Implication of sexual transmission of Zika on dengue and Zika outbreaks.	Dengue and Zika viruses belong to the same Flavivirus family and usually cocirculate within the same area. Both the viruses can be transmitted by a common mosquito species Aedes aegypti. However, non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, such as sexual transmission and vertical transmission, has been reported in recent studies. In this study, we develop a dengue-Zika coinfection model with a particular focus on the impact of Zika sexual transmission to the transmission dynamics of both dengue and Zika. Our sensitivity analysis shows that Zika sexual transmission has a significant influence on the Zika basic reproduction number. Consequently, Zika sexual transmission can lead Zika to be endemic within an area where vector-borne transmission only cannot. Theoretically, we prove that the disease-free equilibrium for dengue only model is always globally stable if the dengue basic reproduction number is less than 1. However, our cascade analysis and numerical simulations show that increasing the sexual transmission coefficient of Zika can also result in the persistence of dengue even though the dengue basic reproduction number is less than 1, due to the cocirculation of dengue and Zika and the antibody-dependent enhancement of Zika infection for dengue infection. Our numerical analyses also show that the endemic levels of Zika increase as the Zika sexual transmission probability increases. <br>	1205	219	9
A mathematical model to study the 2014-2015 large-scale dengue epidemics in Kaohsiung and Tainan cities in Taiwan, China.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection is endemic in many places of the tropical and subtropical regions, which poses serious public health threat globally. We develop and analyze a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of the dengue epidemics. Our qualitative analyzes show that the model has two equilibria, namely the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) which is locally asymp- totically stable when the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than one and unstable if R0 > 1, and endemic equilibrium (EE) which is globally asymp-totically stable when R0 > 1. Further analyzes reveals that the model exhibit the phenomena of backward bifurcation (BB) (a situation where a stable DFE co-exists with a stable EE even when the R0 > 1), which makes the disease control more diffi-cult. The model is applied to the real dengue epidemic data in Kaohsiung and Tainan cities in Taiwan, China to evaluate the fitting performance. We propose two reconstruction approaches to estimate the time-dependent R0 , and we find a consistent fitting results and equivalent goodness-of-fit. Our findings highlight the similarity of the dengue outbreaks in the two cities. We find that despite the proximity in Kaohsiung and Tainan cities, the estimated transmission rates are neither completely synchronized, nor periodically in-phase perfectly in the two cities. We also show the time lags between the seasonal waves in the two cities likely occurred. It is further shown via sensitivity analysis result that proper sanitation of the mosquito breeding sites and avoiding the mosquito bites are the key control measures to future dengue outbreaks in Taiwan. <br>	1390	263	10
Biological view of vaccination described by mathematical modellings: from rubella to dengue vaccines.	The only rubella vaccine available in North America is the RA27/3 strain (isolated from the kidney of a rubella-infected fetus and attenuated) licensed in 1979, which substituted HPV77/DE5 strain vaccine due to concerns about waning immunity. The first dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia CYDTDV) was first registered in Mexico in December, 2015, which is a live recombinant tetravalent dengue vaccine. Rubella vaccine was applied since 1969, but tetravalent dengue vaccine is being used in large scale nowadays. In the past, based on unavailable information regarded to rubella vaccine, mathematical models were used to design vaccination schemes in order to avoid congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Currently, knowing that vaccine does not result in CRS, rubella vaccination is modelled as usual childhood infection. This experience of updated biological knowledge that influenced mathematical modellings of rubella vaccination is taken into account to reflect about the tetravalent dengue vaccine. We also address a discussion about the security of vaccination strategies. <br>	917	159	7

Estimating the burden of dengue and the impact of release of wMel Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Indonesia: a modelling study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWolbachia-infected mosquitoes reduce dengue virus transmission, and city-wide releases in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia, are showing promising entomological results. Accurate estimates of the burden of dengue, its spatial distribution and the potential impact of Wolbachia are critical in guiding funder and government decisions on its future wider use. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere, we combine multiple modelling methods for burden estimation to predict national case burden disaggregated by severity and map the distribution of burden across the country using three separate data sources. An ensemble of transmission models then predicts the estimated reduction in dengue transmission following a nationwide roll-out of wMel Wolbachia. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe estimate that 7.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.8-17.7 million) symptomatic dengue cases occurred in Indonesia in 2015 and were associated with 332,865 (UI 94,175-754,203) lost disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The majority of dengue's burden was due to non-severe cases that did not seek treatment or were challenging to diagnose in outpatient settings leading to substantial underreporting. Estimated burden was highly concentrated in a small number of large cities with 90% of dengue cases occurring in 15.3% of land area. Implementing a nationwide Wolbachia population replacement programme was estimated to avert 86.2% (UI 36.2-99.9%) of cases over a long-term average. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese results suggest interventions targeted to the highest burden cities can have a disproportionate impact on dengue burden. Area-wide interventions, such as Wolbachia, that are deployed based on the area covered could protect people more efficiently than individual-based interventions, such as vaccines, in such dense environments. <br>	1501	720	10
Differential response to plant- and human-derived odorants in field surveillance of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti.	Linalool oxide (LO) and hexanoic acid (HA) represent plant- and human-derived odorants, respectively, previously found as attractants for the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. Here, we investigated if a blend of both compounds can improve captures of this mosquito species in field trials in two dengue endemic sites, Kilifi and Busia Counties in Kenya. Ae. aegypti captures were significantly higher in Kilifi than Busia (χ21,142 = 170.63, P < 0.0001) and varied by treatments (χ25,137 = 151.19, P = 0.002). We found that CO2-baited BG Sentinel traps combined with a blend of both odorants decreased Ae. aegypti captures about 2- to 4-fold compared to captures with the individual compounds (LO or HA) used as positive controls. This was the case for all blends of LO and HA, irrespective of the doses tested. Our findings indicate that combining plant- and human-derived odors may elicit a masking effect in trapping Ae. aegypti. These results partly corroborate previous findings for malaria mosquitoes which showed that combining lures from both host sources either decreases or increases trap catches depending on the dose. Further investigations in the usefulness of combining plant and animal odorants in mosquito trapping are therefore necessary. <br>	1061	202	11
Hijacking the Host Immune Cells by Dengue Virus: Molecular Interplay of Receptors and Dengue Virus Envelope.	Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the lethal pathogens in the hot climatic regions of the world and has been extensively studied to decipher its mechanism of pathogenesis and the missing links of its life cycle. With respect to the entry of DENV, multiple receptors have been recognized in different cells of the human body. However, scientists still argue whether these identified receptors are the exclusive entry mediators for the virus. Adding to the complexity, DENV has been reported to be infecting multiple organ types in its human host. Also, more than one receptor in a particular cell has been discerned to take part in mediating the ingress of DENV. In this review, we aim to discuss the different cells of the human immune system that support DENV infection and their corresponding receptors that DENV deploy to gain access to the cells. <br>	710	144	6

Dengue hemorrhagic fever presenting as encephalitis: a case report.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever incidence is increasing in Sri Lanka, especially among the young population. Uncommon presentations of this common illness make diagnostic dilemmas and can delay standard treatment which leads to unfavorable outcomes. <br><b>CASE PRESENTATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn 18-year-old Sri Lankan Sinhalese boy presented with a history of 1 day of fever and an episode of seizure followed by left-side hemiparesis. He was diagnosed to have dengue complicated by dengue hemorrhagic fever and recovered with minimal residual weakness. He presented with neurological symptoms; cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalogram, and magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of encephalitis. Positive dengue antigen and antibody in serum and cerebrospinal fluid with the exclusion of other possible etiologies confirmed parainfectious dengue encephalitis. He was started on sodium valproate 200 mg 8 hourly and made a slow neurological recovery with mild residual weakness (grade 4+ power) in his left upper limb at 2 months with intensive supervised physiotherapy. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStandard national guideline-based management of dengue illness has significantly reduced its mortality rates in Sri Lanka. However, uncommon presentations of a common illness often cause diagnostic dilemmas. Hence, reporting of these presentations and knowing the epidemiologic patterns of the disease help physicians to arrive at the correct diagnosis even though they do not have sophisticated serological investigations. Overall, this can improve the quality of health care and reduce mortalities, especially in a resource-poor setup. <br>	1370	471	11
Applying fuzzy logic to assess the biogeographical risk of dengue in South America.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOver the last decade, reports about dengue cases have increase worldwide, which is particularly worrisome in South America due to the historic record of dengue outbreaks from the seventeenth century until the first half of the twentieth century. Dengue is a viral disease that involves insect vectors, namely Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, which implies that, to prevent and combat outbreaks, it is necessary to understand the set of ecological and biogeographical factors affecting both the vector species and the virus. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe contribute with a methodology based on fuzzy logic that is helpful to disentangle the main factors that determine favorable environmental conditions for vectors and diseases. Using favorability functions as fuzzy logic modelling technique and the fuzzy intersection, union and inclusion as fuzzy operators, we were able to specify the territories at biogeographical risk of dengue outbreaks in South America. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur results indicate that the distribution of Ae. aegypti mostly encompasses the biogeographical framework of dengue in South America, which suggests that this species is the principal vector responsible for the geographical extent of dengue cases in the continent. Nevertheless, the intersection between the favorability for dengue cases and the union of the favorability for any of the vector species provided a comprehensive map of the biogeographical risk for dengue. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFuzzy logic is an appropriate conceptual and operational tool to tackle the nuances of the vector-illness biogeographical interaction. The application of fuzzy logic may be useful in decision-making by the public health authorities to prevent, control and mitigate vector-borne diseases. <br>	1450	771	10
Dengue and chikungunya among outpatients with acute undifferentiated fever in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo: A cross-sectional study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPathogens causing acute fever, with the exception of malaria, remain largely unidentified in sub-Saharan Africa, given the local unavailability of diagnostic tests and the broad differential diagnosis. <br><b>METHODOLOGY:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe conducted a cross-sectional study including outpatient acute undifferentiated fever in both children and adults, between November 2015 and June 2016 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests for selected arboviral infections were performed on blood, including PCR, NS1-RDT, ELISA and IFA for acute, and ELISA and IFA for past infections. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInvestigation among 342 patients, aged 2 to 68 years (mean age of 21 years), with acute undifferentiated fever (having no clear focus of infection) revealed 19 (8.1%) acute dengue-caused by DENV-1 and/or DENV-2 -and 2 (0.9%) acute chikungunya infections. Furthermore, 30.2% and 26.4% of participants had been infected in the past with dengue and chikungunya, respectively. We found no evidence of acute Zika nor yellow fever virus infections. 45.3% of patients tested positive on malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test, 87.7% received antimalarial treatment and 64.3% received antibacterial treatment. <br><b>DISCUSSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChikungunya outbreaks have been reported in the study area in the past, so the high seroprevalence is not surprising. However, scarce evidence exists on dengue transmission in Kinshasa and based on our data, circulation is more important than previously reported. Furthermore, our study shows that the prescription of antibiotics, both antibacterial and antimalarial drugs, is rampant. Studies like this one, elucidating the causes of acute fever, may lead to a more considerate and rigorous use of antibiotics. This will not only stem the ever-increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance, but will-ultimately and hopefully-improve the clinical care of outpatients in low-resource settings. <br><b>TRIAL REGISTRATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClinicalTrials.gov NCT02656862. <br>	1640	999	12
A Graph-Based Approach for Finding the Dengue Infection Pathways in Humans Using Protein-Protein Interactions.	                     Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the deadly arboviruses, which is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti, and causes dengue infection to the humans. According to WHO, every year around 390 million humans are affected by DENV, of which around 50 million deaths are reported. Knowledge of the various diseases caused by the DENV would greatly encourage to understand the infection mechanism and help to design new antiviral drug discovery. We propose a quasi-clique and quasi-biclique algorithm to classify infection gateway proteins of the human body and possible pathways of DENV leading to various diseases. For this, we have examined three networks, dengue-human protein-protein interaction network, human protein interaction network, and human proteins-disease association network. The prediction result states that DENV may lead to various diseases in the human body, including cancer, asthma, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, premature birth, and so on. Some of the results have recently been validated experimentally. This study may endow with potential targets for more effective anti-dengue remedial contribution.                  <br>	968	171	8
Predictive Models for the Medical Diagnosis of Dengue: A Case Study in Paraguay.	Early diagnosis of dengue continues to be a concern for public health in countries with a high incidence of this disease. In this work, we compared two machine learning techniques: artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) as assistance tools for medical diagnosis. The performance of classification models was evaluated in a real dataset of patients with a previous diagnosis of dengue extracted from the public health system of Paraguay during the period 2012-2016. The ANN multilayer perceptron achieved better results with an average of 96% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and 97% specificity, with low variation in thirty different partitions of the dataset. In comparison, SVM polynomial obtained results above 90% for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. <br>	673	120	4
Clinical prognostic models for severe dengue: a systematic review protocol.	Background: Dengue is a common mosquito-borne, with high morbidity rates recorded in the annual. Dengue contributes to a major disease burden in many tropical countries. This demonstrates the urgent need in developing effective approaches to identify severe cases early. For this purpose, many multivariable prognostic models using multiple prognostic variables were developed to predict the risk of progression to severe outcomes. The aim of the planned systematic review is to identify and describe the existing clinical multivariable prognostic models for severe dengue as well as examine the possibility of combining them. These findings will suggest directions for further research of this field. Methods: This protocol has followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P). We will conduct a comprehensive search of Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria include being published in peer-review journals, focusing on human subjects and developing the multivariable prognostic model for severe dengue, without any restriction on language, location and period of publication, and study design. The reference list will be captured and removed from duplications. We will use the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) checklist to extract data and Prediction study risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) to assess the study quality. Discussion: This systematic review will describe the existing prediction models, summarize the current status of prognostic research on dengue, and report the possibility to combine the models to optimize the power of each paradigm.

Vertical transmission of dengue virus in Aedes aegypti and its role in the epidemiological persistence of dengue in Central and Southern Mexico.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the main mosquito species responsible for dengue virus (DENV) transmission to humans in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The role of vertical transmission in the epidemiology of dengue and the maintenance of this arbovirus in nature during interepidemic periods remain poorly understood, and DENV vertical transmission could sustain the existence of virus reservoirs within Aedes populations. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBetween April 2011 to October 2012 we monitored vertical transmission of DENV in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in 9 cities of 4 Mexican states. Aedes eggs were collected in ovitraps, then adults were reared under laboratory conditions and their heads were used to infect C6/36 cells. The presence of flavivirus was detected by immunofluorescence assays (IFA) and DENV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp96% of reared adults were Ae. aegypti and 4.0% were Ae. albopictus. No infection was detected in Ae. albopictus, whereas 54 of 713 (7.8%) of Ae. aegypti pools tested positive. A minimum infection rate (MIR) of 2.52 per 1000 mosquitoes was estimated for Ae. aegypti. DENV-1, DENV-2 & DENV-3 serotypes were detected even during interepidemic periods. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study reports the evidence of vertical transmission of dengue virus with viral isolation and molecular confirmation in Ae. aegypti eggs collected in four endemic regions of Central and Southern Mexico. Vertical transmission may play a role as a reservoir mechanism during mosquito dormancy in interepidemic periods but with minor participation in transmission during epidemic periods.

Modelling the Effect of a Novel Autodissemination Trap on the Spread of Dengue in Shah Alam and Malaysia.	In this paper, we will start off by introducing the classical Ross-Macdonald model for vector-borne diseases which we use to describe the transmission of dengue between humans and Aedes mosquitoes in Shah Alam, which is a city and the state capital of Selangor, Malaysia. We will focus on analysing the effect of using the Mosquito Home System (MHS), which is an example of an autodissemination trap, in reducing the number of dengue cases by changing the Ross-Macdonald model. By using the national dengue data from Malaysia, we are able to estimate λ, which represents the initial growth rate of the dengue epidemic, and this allows us to estimate the number of mosquitoes in Malaysia. A mathematical expression is also constructed which allows us to estimate the potential number of breeding sites of Aedes mosquitoes. By using the data available from the MHS trial carried out in Section 15 of Shah Alam, we included the potential effect of the MHS into the dengue model and thus modelled the impact MHS has on the spread of dengue within the trial area. We then extended our results to analyse the effect of the MHSs on reducing the number of dengue cases in the whole of Malaysia. A new model was constructed with a basic reproduction number, R0,MalaMHS, which allows us to identify the required MHSs coverage needed to achieve extinction in Malaysia. Numerical simulations and tables of results were also produced to illustrate our results. <br>	1211	248	8
Contribution of Toll like receptor polymorphisms to dengue susceptibility and clinical outcome among eastern Indian patients.	Dengue infection has been one of the major public health concerns in India causing simple dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue infection. In the present study, contribution of TLR3, 7 and 8 polymorphisms towards dengue disease susceptibility and severity among Eastern Indian patients was analysed. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood of 201 dengue infected patients and 157 healthy individuals, followed by genotyping of eight polymorphisms of TLR3 (rs3775290), TLR7 (rs5741880, rs3853839, rs179008 and rs179010) and TLR8 (rs3764879, rs3764880 and rs5744080) genes by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Functional analyses of the polymorphisms were predicted. Genotypic association of polymorphisms, alone and in combination, with dengue disease susceptibility and development of WHO-defined warning signs among patients was calculated by using SPSS software. TLR7-rs179008 & TLR8-rs3764880 were implicated to be non-synonymous polymorphisms. Specific genotypes of majority of the analysed TLR polymorphisms exhibited significant positive association with disease susceptibility. CC/C and AA/A of TLR7-rs179008 (p < 0.0001) and TLR8-rs3764880 (p < 0.00001) respectively were significantly associated with development of warning signs among dengue infected patients. Particular genotypic combinations of rs3853839-rs5744080 and rs179008-rs3764880 increased the risk of dengue infectivity, whereas, presence of last combination was more prevalent among dengue patients with warning signs. Thus these polymorphic variants of TLR3, 7 and 8 might act as potential prognostic biomarkers for predicting disease severity among dengue virus infected patients. <br>	1475	238	10
A protective Zika virus E-dimer-based subunit vaccine engineered to abrogate antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue infection.	Infections with dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) can induce cross-reactive antibody responses. Two immunodominant epitopes-one to precursor membrane protein and one to the fusion loop epitope on envelope (E) protein-are recognized by cross-reactive antibodies1-3 that are not only poorly neutralizing, but can also promote increased viral replication and disease severity via Fcγ receptor-mediated infection of myeloid cells-a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)1,4,5. ADE is a significant concern for both ZIKV and DENV vaccines as the induction of poorly neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies may prime an individual for ADE on natural infection. In this report, we describe the design and production of covalently stabilized ZIKV E dimers, which lack precursor membrane protein and do not expose the immunodominant fusion loop epitope. Immunization of mice with ZIKV E dimers induces dimer-specific antibodies, which protect against ZIKV challenge during pregnancy. Importantly, the ZIKV E-dimer-induced response does not cross-react with DENV or induce ADE of DENV infection. <br>	957	172	6

Gravid oviposition sticky trap and dengue non-structural 1 antigen test for early surveillance of dengue in multi-storey dwellings: study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is a global disease, transmitted by the Aedes vectors. In 2018, there were 80 615 dengue cases with 147 deaths in Malaysia. Currently, the nationwide surveillance programs are dependent on Aedes larval surveys and notifications of lab-confirmed human infections. The existing, reactive programs appear to lack sensitivity and proactivity. More efficient dengue vector surveillance/control methods are needed. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA parallel, cluster, randomized controlled, interventional trial is being conducted for 18 months in Damansara Damai, Selangor, Malaysia, to determine the efficacy of using gravid oviposition sticky (GOS) trap and dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) antigen test for early surveillance of dengue among Aedes mosquitoes to reduce dengue outbreaks. Eight residential apartments were randomly assigned into intervention and control arms. GOS traps are set at the apartments to collect Aedes weekly, following which dengue NS1 antigen is detected in these mosquitoes. When a dengue-positive mosquito is detected, the community will be advised to execute vector search-and-destroy and protective measures. The primary outcome concerns the the percentage change in the (i) number of dengue cases and (ii) durations of dengue outbreaks. Whereas other outcome measures include the change in density threshold of Aedes and changes in dengue-related knowledge, attitude and practice among cluster inhabitants. <br><b>DISCUSSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a proactive and early dengue surveillance in the mosquito vector that does not rely on notification of dengue cases. Surveillance using the GOS traps should be able to efficiently provide sufficient coverage for multistorey dwellings where population per unit area is likely to be higher. Furthermore, trapping dengue-infected mosquitoes using the GOS trap, helps to halt the dengue transmission carried by the mosquito. It is envisaged that the results of this randomized controlled trial will provide a new proactive, cheap and targeted surveillance tool for the prevention and control of dengue outbreaks. <br><b>TRIAL REGISTRATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a parallel-cluster, randomized controlled, interventional trial, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT03799237), on 8th January 2019 (retrospectively registered). <br>	1893	977	16
Expression Pattern of Selected Toll-like Receptors (TLR's) in the PBMC's of Severe and Non-severe Dengue Cases.	Objective: The role of TLR's in the pathogenesis of dengue is not explored well. Differential expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was reported in dengue cases. In the present study in order to understand the expression pattern of various TLR's, including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR9, mRNA levels were determined in various dengue study groups compared to control groups, at the time of admission and around defervescence using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Methods: A total of 88 dengue cases with 32 severe and 56 non-severe cases were involved in the study. Gene expression pattern of the study groups was compared with 31 other febrile illness (OFI) cases and 63 healthy controls. Transcript levels of the target genes were estimated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples collected from cases and controls using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: We have noted a significant alteration in the levels of all TLR's in dengue and OFI cases compared to healthy controls at the time of admission. Interestingly we have noted a significant alteration in the levels of TLR9 in severe and non-severe cases during defervescence. The same was not detected in the OFI group. Conclusion: The present study found a change in TLR's during dengue infection. This suggests us to explore the TLR's as therapeutic candidate for anti-dengue virus strategies. However, in order to ascertain the involvement of TLR's in the disease pathology and its role as biomarkers for prognosis, a complete dynamics of TLR's expression needs to be studied. <br>	1306	261	12
Dengue virus serotype-4 during the 2015-2017 epidemic: emergence of a novel genotype IIa of DENV-4 in the Philippines.	Dengue remains a major public health problem in the Philippines. Here, we determined the circulating serotypes in the Philippines during the 2015-2017 outbreaks by using a total of 678 serum samples that were collected from 537 individual dengue patients. Following an increase in the percentage of DENV-4 patients in recent years, we conducted a comprehensive molecular epidemiology analysis on the DENV-4 strains isolated recently in the Philippines. While two genotypes of DENV-4 have been isolated in the Philippines since 1956, the GI and GIIa which were the DENV-4 strains isolated in this study were closely related to a distinct group of GIIa strains that were isolated from the Philippines since 2004. A majority of the isolates of this sub-group has been identified in the Philippines, suggesting that the lineage may have been introduced and evolved in the Philippines to form the distinct sub-group within GIIa strains. The increase in DENV-4 activity also coincided with the appearance of GIIa sub-group and the phasing-out of GI lineage in the Philippines. Overall, our study demonstrates a shift in DENV-4 genotype and epidemic dynamics in a hyperendemic region, suggesting the importance of DENV genetic evolution in establishing and sustaining transmission. <br>	1084	209	6
Two cases of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) infection in a Japanese couple returning from Maldives in the dengue outbreak in 2018.	Annually, more than 1.2 million travelers from other countries visit Maldives for sightseeing, business and honeymoons. In 2018, the largest dengue fever outbreak occurred and more than 3,200 people were affected. During this outbreak, we encountered a newly married Japanese couple returning from Maldives on their honeymoon in October 2018, both of which got infected by dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) during the travel. The number of imported dengue fever cases from Maldives may increase, hence, physicians should keep a sharp watch on up-to-date dengue outbreak information all over the world. <br>	511	98	4
Formation of Virus-Like Particles of the Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Expressed in Silkworm Larvae.	To explore virus-like particles formation of dengue virus serotype type 2 (DENV-2) structural proteins of, C, prM, E were expressed in silkworm larvae using recombinant Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedroviruses (BmNPV). Each recombinant BmNPV bacmid coding the 2C-prM-E polypeptide and E protein fused with the signal peptide of bombyxin from B. mori was injected into silkworm larvae. The expressed proteins were collected from hemolymph and fat body, and purified using affinity chromatography. E protein was observed at 55 kDa. The DENV virus-like particles (DENV-LPs) with a diameter approximately 35 nm was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunogold-labelling TEM analysis. The binding of each partially purified proteins to heparin, one of receptors for DENV was confirmed. DENV-LPs were secreted in silkworm larval hemolymph even still low amount, but the E protein and heparin binding function were confirmed. <br>	806	146	8
Influence of directional positive Darwinian selection-driven evolution on arboviruses Dengue and Zika virulence and pathogenesis.	Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are antigenically and evolutionarily related; immunological cross-reactions between them have been associated to both cross-protection and infection-enhanced mechanisms. Here, DENV-1-4 and ZIKV were investigated through Bayesian coalescent-based approaches and selection-driven Darwinian evolution methods using robust datasets. Our findings show that both DENV and ZIKV, driven essentially by directional positive selection, have undergone evolution and diversification and that their entire polyproteins are subject to an intense directional evolution. Interestingly, positively selected codons mapped here are directly associated to DENV-1-2 virulence as well as the ZIKV burgeoning 2015-16 outbreak in the Americas, therefore, having impact on the pathogenesis of these viruses. Biochemical prediction analysis focusing on markers involved in virulence and viral transmission dynamics identified alterations in N-Glycosylation-, Phosphorylation- and Palmitoylation-sites in ZIKV sampled from different countries, hosts and isolation sources. Taking into account both DENV-ZIKV co-circulation either into and/or out of flavivirus-endemic regions, as well as recombination and quasispecies scenarios, these results indicate the action of a selection-driven evolution affecting the biology, virulence and pathogenesis of these pathogens in a non-randomized environment. <br>	1237	197	6
De novo design approaches targeting an envelope protein pocket to identify small molecules against dengue virus.	Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has become a major public health concern worldwide. This disease presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from a mild cold-like illness to the more serious hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome. Currently, neither an approved drug nor an effective vaccine for the treatment are available to fight the disease. The envelope protein (E) is a major component of the virion surface. This protein plays a key role during the viral entry process, constituting an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. The crystal structure of the E protein reveals the existence of a hydrophobic pocket occupied by the detergent n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (β-OG). This pocket lies at the hinge region between domains I and II and is important for the low pH-triggered conformational rearrangement required for the fusion of the virion with the host's cell. Aiming at the design of novel molecules which bind to E and act as virus entry inhibitors, we undertook a de novo design approach by "growing" molecules inside the hydrophobic site (β-OG). From more than 240000 small-molecules generated, the 2,4 pyrimidine scaffold was selected as the best candidate, from which one synthesized compound displayed micromolar activity. Molecular dynamics-based optimization was performed on this hit, and thirty derivatives were designed in silico, synthesized and evaluated on their capacity to inhibit dengue virus entry into the host cell. Four compounds were found to be potent antiviral compounds in the low-micromolar range. The assessment of drug-like physicochemical and in vitro pharmacokinetic properties revealed that compounds 3e and 3h presented acceptable solubility values and were stable in mouse plasma, simulated gastric fluid, simulated intestinal fluid, and phosphate buffered saline solution. <br>	1599	298	12
Clinical relevance of gallbladder wall thickening for dengue severity: A cross-sectional study.	Dengue fever is the most important arthropod-borne viral infection worldwide. Secondary prevention to reduce mortality through improved clinical case management has substantially lowered the mortality rate for severe dengue during the past two decades. Gallbladder wall thickening (GBWT) is a nonspecific finding often associated with more severe cases of dengue infection. This study had the aim to describe the ultrasonographic findings in hospitalized patients with dengue infection from Manaus (in the Western Brazilian Amazon) and to correlate the GBWT with dengue severity, symptoms and laboratorial analysis. Patients from 13-84 years admitted to the emergency department at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) were enrolled in this study. Patients' selection occurred during the most recent and huge dengue outbreak within the first semester of 2011. All enrolled subjects were systematically tested in order to rule out other possible etiologies for gallbladder inflammation. Abdominal ultrasound was performed by a single physician through bedside portable equipment and all other clinical and laboratorial information were retrieved from patients' electronic files. 54 subjects were considered for analysis, with confirmed dengue infection by NS1 and/or RT-PCR positivity. From all enrolled patients, 50 (42.4%) presented GBWT. GBWT was significantly and independently related to: age under 31 years, pregnancy, presence of bleeding, presence of any cavitary effusion, DHF classification and severe dengue classifications. During dengue outbreaks, the GBWT identification through a non-invasive and bedside procedure is a confident marker for prompt recognition of potential severe cases. <br>	1497	251	12
Developing a Digital Solution for Dengue Through Epihack: Qualitative Evaluation Study of a Five-Day Health Hackathon in Sri Lanka.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has increasingly affected Sri Lanka in recent years. To address this issue, dengue surveillance through increasingly prevalent digital surveillance applications has been suggested for use by health authorities and the general public. Epihack Sri Lanka was a 5-day hackathon event organized to develop a digital dengue surveillance tool. <br><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe goal of the research was to examine the effectiveness of a collaborative hackathon that brought together information technology (IT) and health experts from around the globe to develop a solution to the dengue pandemic in Sri Lanka. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEthnographic observation and qualitative informal interviews were conducted with 58 attendees from 11 countries over the 5-day Epihack to identify the main factors that influence a collaborative hackathon. Interviews were transcribed and coded based on grounded theory. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThree major themes were identified during the Epihack Sri Lanka event: engagement, communication, and current disease environment. Unlike other hackathons, Epihack had no winners or prizes and was collaborative rather than competitive, which worked well in formulating a variety of ideas and bringing together volunteers with a sense of civic duty to improve public health. Having health and IT experts work together concurrently was received positively and considered highly beneficial to the development of the product. Participants were overall very satisfied with the event, although they thought it could have been longer. Communication issues and cultural differences were observed but continued to decrease as the event progressed. This was found to be extremely important to the efficiency of the event, which highlighted the benefit of team-bonding exercises. Bringing expert knowledge and examples of systems from around the world benefited the creation of new ideas. However, developing a system that can adapt and cater to the local disease environment is important in successfully developing the concepts. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEpihack Sri Lanka was successful in bringing together health and IT experts to develop a digital solution for dengue surveillance. The collaborative format achieved a variety of fruitful ideas and may lead to more hackathons working in this way in the future. Good communication, participant engagement, and stakeholder interest with adaptation of ideas to complement the current environment are vital to achieve the goals of the event. <br>	2089	1075	17
Twenty-Two years of dengue fever (1996-2017): an epidemiological study in a Brazilian city.	This ecological study analyzed the temporal pattern of clinically diagnosed and laboratory confirmed dengue cases in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil from 1996 to 2017. The study was divided into two analytical parts, the first of which evaluated the association between dengue incidence and host and climatic factors. The second part encompassed data from 2002 to 2017 and examined dengue incidence in relation to virus serotype and an intra-urban socioeconomic index. Over 22 years there were 469,171 cases and four epidemic peaks. There was an increase in the number, severity, and lethality of cases over the last 10 years of the study period. Biological and environmental factors appear to modulate the behavior of dengue in a large urban center. <br>	642	123	5
NK cells are activated and primed for skin-homing during acute dengue virus infection in humans.	Despite animal models showing that natural killer (NK) cells are important players in the early defense against many viral infections, the NK cell response is poorly understood in humans. Here we analyze the phenotype, temporal dynamics, regulation and trafficking of NK cells in a patient cohort with acute dengue virus infection. NK cells are robustly activated and proliferate during the first week after symptom debut. Increased IL-18 levels in plasma and in induced skin blisters of DENV-infected patients, as well as concomitant signaling downstream of the IL-18R, suggests an IL-18-dependent mechanism in driving the proliferative NK cell response. Responding NK cells have a less mature phenotype and a distinct chemokine-receptor imprint indicative of skin-homing. A corresponding NK cell subset can be localized to skin early during acute infection. These data provide evidence of an IL-18-driven NK cell proliferation and priming for skin-homing during an acute viral infection in humans. <br>	856	161	7
Haemolytic anaemia precipitated by dengue fever.	We reported a case of a woman with no past medical illness who presented with a few days' history of fever, myalgia, arthralgia, hypochromic microcytic anaemia and thrombocytopaenia and who was nonstructural protein 1 antigen (NS1Ag)-positive. Haemolytic anaemia including full blood picture work-up revealed high reticulocyte count and haemolysis with positive direct Coombs test. She was started on prednisolone and was discharged well. <br>	381	67	3
Contemporary Strategies and Current Trends in Designing Antiviral Drugs against Dengue Fever via Targeting Host-Based Approaches.	Dengue virus (DENV) is an arboviral human pathogen transmitted through mosquito bite that infects an estimated ~400 million humans (~5% of the global population) annually. To date, no specific therapeutics have been developed that can prevent or treat infections resulting from this pathogen. DENV utilizes numerous host molecules and factors for transcribing the single-stranded ~11 kb positive-sense RNA genome. For example, the glycosylation machinery of the host is required for viral particles to assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum. Since a variety of host factors seem to be utilized by the pathogens, targeting these factors may result in DENV inhibitors, and will play an important role in attenuating the rapid emergence of other flaviviruses. Many experimental studies have yielded findings indicating that host factors facilitate infection, indicating that the focus should be given to targeting the processes contributing to pathogenesis along with many other immune responses. Here, we provide an extensive literature review in order to elucidate the progress made in the development of host-based approaches for DENV viral infections, focusing on host cellular mechanisms and factors responsible for viral replication, aiming to aid the potential development of host-dependent antiviral therapeutics. <br>	1133	196	7
Immunogenicity and safety of a dengue vaccine given as a booster in Singapore: a randomized Phase II, placebo-controlled trial evaluating its effects 5-6 years after completion of the primary series.	The tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV; Dengvaxia®) is administered on a three-dose schedule, 6 months apart in those aged ≥9 years in a number of dengue-endemic countries in Asia and Latin America. In this study, CYD63 (NCT02824198), participants aged 9-45 years at first vaccination, and who had received three doses of CYD-TDV in the CYD28 study more than 5 years previously, were randomized 3:1 to receive a booster CYD-TDV dose (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2). Dengue neutralizing antibody geometric mean titres (PRNT50 GMTs) for each of the four dengue serotypes were assessed in sera collected before and 28 days after booster injections. Non-inferiority of the booster immune response versus that induced after the third dose was demonstrated for each serotype if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was >0.5 for the GMT ratios (GMTRs) between post-booster CYD-TDV dose and post-dose 3 in Group 1. Overall, 118 participants received CYD-TDV booster or placebo and 116 (98.3%) completed the study; two participants were withdrawn because of noncompliance. GMTs in the booster CYD-TDV group increased across all serotypes post-booster injection by 1.74- (serotype 1) to 3.58-fold (serotype 4). No discernible increases were observed in the placebo group. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for serotypes 1, 3 and 4, but not for serotype 2 (GMTR; 0.603 [95% CI, 0.439; 0.829]). No safety issues were observed. These data show that the CYD-TDV booster given 5 or more years later tended to restore GMTs back to levels observed post-dose 3. <br>	1327	274	10
Simultaneous detection of IgM antibodies against dengue and chikungunya: Coinfection or cross-reactivity?	<b>Background:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue and chikungunya sharing same mosquito vector are two most important arboviruses circulating in northern India including Delhi and are responsible for frequent outbreaks. Antigen and antibodies detection ELISA kits are the major tool to diagnose these viral illnesses, and are sometimes associated with cross-reactivity, giving a false picture of coinfection, although simultaneous harboring of both the viruses is not uncommon. Various studies have reported coinfection up to 25% from the same region. <br><b>Procedure:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, during the month of September 2016 which included 200 blood samples from clinically suspected cases attending Medicine OPD of associated Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi. Diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya was made using NS-1 antigen and IgM MAC ELISA for dengue and IgM MAC ELISA for chikungunya as per manufacturer's instructions. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOut of 200 suspected cases, 34 (17%) were positive for dengue serology, 77 (38.5%) were positive for chikungunya serology, and 29.9% of positive chikungunya cases were simultaneously affected with dengue. This higher percentage of coinfection might be because of cross-reactivity of the ELISA kits. <br><b>Discussion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIndia being a hyperendemic region for dengue and chikungunya, frequent outbreaks are quite common. Circulation of both the virus and huge susceptible population are the major causes for frequent outbreaks. Restricting our attention to diagnose one of them is not sufficient, and coinfection further complicates the illness. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSimultaneous diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya is need of time to diagnose dual infection and prevent complications by starting supportive treatment well in time. Molecular technique if ever possible should be employed whenever the coinfection number is higher than expected to rule out cross-reactivity. <br>	1602	1047	12
The eye in dengue fever, a rarely appreciated aspect of dengue expanded syndrome: a case report.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever is a mosquito-borne illness prevalent mainly in the tropics. It is feared for causing the dengue hemorrhagic spectrum of the disease leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Its rarer manifestations are categorized as the expanded dengue syndrome, and though being recognized, they are not fully appreciated and understood. The involvement of the eye in dengue fever is one such phenomenon. <br><b>CASE PRESENTATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA 27-year-old South-Asian woman presented on day 2 of dengue fever, without capillary leakage, for further management. Despite developing hepatitis, she had an otherwise uncomplicated progression of the illness because she did not develop capillary leakage. On day 8 of the illness, she had the lowest platelet count and developed bilateral blurred vision. Examination revealed that only gross movements were detected in the left eye, and the right eye had a visual acuity of 6/9. She was diagnosed with foveolitis in the right eye and central serous chorioretinopathy in the left eye, along with hemorrhages in both eyes. These were confirmed by funduscopy, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and macular scans. She received systemic and intravitreal steroids and was assessed regularly. After 6 months of observation, her visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye, which remained the same thereafter. <br><b>DISCUSSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe exact mechanism of eye involvement in dengue viral infection is poorly understood. Multiple causes have been suspected and include viral factors, immune mediation, capillary leakage, stress, and hemorrhage. Eye involvement is classically seen at the lowest platelet count and when the count begins to rise. Though symptoms are nonpathognomonic, blurring of vision is the commonest complaint, but the range of presentation is extensive and variable. Ophthalmological assessment and funduscopy are very useful in addition to advanced assessments. There is no clear consensus on management; suggestions range from conservative care to aggressive steroid therapy with immune modulation and even ophthalmological intervention. Recovery can be full or partial with a variable time scale. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe extensive spectrum of possible visual symptoms should prompt the clinician to suspect any visual complaint as potential dengue eye involvement. Guided studies and screening are needed to better understand the true incidence of eye involvement in dengue fever. <br>	2050	1058	21
A Dengue Virus Type 2 (DENV-2) NS4B-Interacting Host Factor, SERP1, Reduces DENV-2 Production by Suppressing Viral RNA Replication.	Host cells infected with dengue virus (DENV) often trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key process that allows viral reproduction, without killing the host cells until the late stage of the virus life-cycle. However, little is known regarding which DENV viral proteins interact with the ER machinery to support viral replication. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel host factor, stress-associated ER protein 1 (SERP1), which interacts with the DENV type 2 (DENV-2) NS4B protein by several assays, for example, yeast two-hybrid, subcellular localization, NanoBiT complementation, and co-immunoprecipitation. A drastic increase (34.5-fold) in the SERP1 gene expression was observed in the DENV-2-infected or replicon-transfected Huh7.5 cells. The SERP1 overexpression inhibited viral yields (37-fold) in the DENV-2-infected Huh7.5 cells. In contrast, shRNAi-knockdown and the knockout of SERP1 increased the viral yields (3.4- and 16-fold, respectively) in DENV-2-infected HEK-293 and Huh7.5 cells, respectively. DENV-2 viral RNA replication was severely reduced in stable SERP1-expressing Huh7.5 cells transfected with DENV-2 replicon plasmids. The overexpression of DENV-2 NS4B alleviated the inhibitory effect of SERP1 on DENV-2 RNA replication. Taking these results together, we hypothesized that SERP1 may serve as an antiviral player during ER stress to restrict DENV-2 infection. Our studies revealed novel anti-DENV drug targets that may facilitate anti-DENV drug discovery. <br>	1305	242	10
Chronic Dengue Virus Panencephalitis in a Patient with Progressive Dementia with Extrapyramidal Features.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo determine the underlying etiology in a patient with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal signs and chronic inflammation referred to the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExtensive investigations included metabolic profile, autoantibody panel, infectious etiologies, genetic screening, whole exome sequencing, and the phage-display assay, VirScan, for viral immune responses. An etiological diagnosis was established postmortem. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing VirScan, enrichment of dengue viral antibodies was detected in cerebrospinal fluid as compared to serum. No virus was detected in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, but postmortem analysis confirmed dengue virus in the brain by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing. Dengue virus was also detectable by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing from brain biopsy tissue collected 33 months antemortem, confirming a chronic infection despite a robust immune response directed against the virus. Immunoprofiling and whole exome sequencing of the patient did not reveal any immunodeficiency, and sequencing of the virus demonstrated wild-type dengue virus in the central nervous system. <br><b>INTERPRETATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue virus is the most common arbovirus worldwide and represents a significant public health concern. Infections with dengue virus are usually self-limiting, and chronic dengue infections have not been previously reported. Our findings suggest that dengue virus infections may persist in the central nervous system causing a panencephalitis and should be considered in patients with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal features in endemic regions or with relevant travel history. Furthermore, this work highlights the utility of comprehensive antibody profiling assays to aid in the diagnosis of encephalitis of unknown etiology. ANN NEUROL 2019. <br>	1613	585	11
Dengue Non-structural Protein 5 Polymerase Complexes With Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein (PML) Isoforms III and IV to Disrupt PML-Nuclear Bodies in Infected Cells.	Dengue virus (DENV) threatens almost 70% of the world's population, with no therapeutic currently available. The severe, potentially lethal forms of DENV disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome) are associated with the production of high level of cytokines, elicited as part of the host antiviral response, although the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We previously showed that infection by DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) disrupts promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene product nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) after viral protein translation in infected cells. Apart from playing a key role as the nucleating agent in forming PML-NBs, PML has antiviral activity against various viruses, including DENV. The present study builds on this work, showing for the first time that all four DENV serotypes elicit PML-NB breakdown. Importantly, we show for the first time that of the nuclear localizing proteins of DENV, DENV non-structural protein (NS) 5 polymerase alone is sufficient to elicit PML-NB disassembly, in part through complexing with PML isoforms III and IV, but not other PML isoforms or other PML-NB components. The results raise the possibility that PML-NB disruption by nuclear localized NS5 contributes to DENV's suppression of the host antiviral response. <br>	1100	203	7
The Difference of Angiopoietin-2 Levels between Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Patients with Shock and without Shock.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue infection is one of the problems in the national health sector in Indonesia because the incidence and mortality in Indonesia due to dengue infection is still very high. In 2005 Indonesia became the highest contributor to dengue infection in Southeast Asia (53%) with 95.270 people and 1.298 deaths. <br><b>AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study aims to analyse differences in angiopoietin-2 levels in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with and without shock. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study was a consecutive sampling design with the research subject was obtained based on the order of admission to the hospital - the serum Angiopoietin-2 levels using the ELISA method. The statistical test used is the independent t-test. The value of p < 0.05 was said to be statistically significant. <br><b>RESULT:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe result showed that the mean of Angiopoietin-2 levels in DHF patients with shock was higher than in DHF (p < 0.05). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study concluded that there was a difference in the average level of Angiopoietin-2 among DHF patients with shock compared to without shock. <br>	841	682	8
Systematic review of dengue vaccine efficacy.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue is an arbovirus that has rapidly spread worldwide, and the incidence of dengue has greatly increased in recent decades. The actual numbers of dengue cases are underreported, and many cases are not classified correctly. Recent estimates indicate that 390 million dengue infections occur per year (95% CI, 284-528 million), of which 96 million (67-136 million) are symptomatic infections of any severity. One of the goals of the World Health Organization is to reduce dengue mortality by 50% by the year 2020. The use of a vaccine can be an important strategy to achieve this goal. Vaccines for dengue are in various stages of development; in Brazil, only one commercial formulation is available (CYD-TDV), which was developed by Sanofi Pasteur. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo evaluate the efficacy of Dengue vaccine, a systematic review with a meta-analysis was conducted using randomized controlled clinical trials published between 2000 and 2017 that were identified in the MEDLINE databases via PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. The selection was performed by two reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeven clinical trials were included, with a total of 36,371 participants (66,511 person-years) between the ages of 2 and 45 years. The meta-analysis using the random-effects model estimated the efficacy of the vaccine at 44%, with a range from 25 to 59% and high heterogeneity (I2 = 80.1%). The serotype-stratified meta-analysis was homogeneous, except for serotype 2, with the heterogeneity of 64.5%. Most of the vaccinated individuals had previous immunity for at least one serotype, which generated safety concerns in individuals without previous immunity. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCompared with other commercially available vaccines, the dengue vaccine showed poor efficacy. <br>	1519	937	12
Breteau index as a promising early warning signal for dengue fever outbreaks in the Colombo District, Sri Lanka.	Despite the efforts in reducing vector densities, outbreaks of dengue fever have become a frequent event in Sri Lanka. As explained by dengue transmission dynamics, vector control activities intensified at peak or near peak outbreak situations would not be successful in controlling the outbreaks. A reliable method of outbreak prediction is always warranted for early preparedness. Relationships between the monthly Breteau indices of the two vector species (Aedes aegypti L. and Ae. albopictus Skuse) and the monthly dengue incidence in a selected high-risk health division (Kaduwela) in the Colombo District, Sri Lanka were determined for three consecutive years, 2009 to 2011. The same procedure was extended for the whole Colombo District from 2013 to 2016. Cross correlation functions were used to determine the relationships with the corresponding lag-periods. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (ROC) were constructed to determine the performance of the Breteau indices as predictors of impending dengue outbreaks and to establish the threshold values. The pronounced performance with >80% areas under ROC curves and >75% sensitivity and >70% specificity of threshold values with defined lag-periods in correlations emphasize the importance of the Breteau index as a promising early warning signal for dengue outbreaks. The results indicate the importance of the carefully planned routine vector larval surveillance in dengue control programs which would make reliable outbreak predictions with a sufficient window period for early preparedness. <br>	1340	230	9
Why should we apply ABM for decision analysis for infectious diseases?-An example for dengue interventions.	For the evaluation of infectious-diseases interventions, the transmissible nature of such diseases plays a central role. Agent-based models (ABM) allow for dynamic transmission modeling but publications are limited. We aim to provide an overview of important characteristics of ABM for decision-analytic modeling of infectious diseases. A case study of dengue epidemics illustrates model characteristics, conceptualization, calibration and model analysis. First, major characteristics of ABM are outlined and discussed based on ISPOR and ISPOR-SMDM Good Practice guidelines. Second, in our case study, we modeled a dengue outbreak in Cebu City (Philippines) to assess the impact interventions to control the relative growth of the mosquito population. Model outcomes include prevalence and incidence of infected persons. The modular ABM simulates persons and mosquitoes over an annual time horizon considering daily time steps. The model was calibrated and validated. ABM is a dynamic, individual-level modeling approach that is capable to reproduce direct and indirect effects of interventions for infectious diseases. The ability to replicate emerging behavior and to include human behavior or the behavior of other agents is a distinguishing modeling characteristic (e.g., compared to Markov models). Modeling behavior may, however, require extensive calibration and validation. The analyzed hypothetical effectiveness of dengue interventions showed that a reduced human-mosquito ratio of 1:2.5 during rainy seasons leads already to a substantial decrease of infected persons. ABM can support decision-analyses for infectious diseases including disease dynamics, emerging behavior, and providing a high level of reusability due to modularity. <br>	1510	253	14
Selection on Aedes aegypti alters Wolbachia-mediated dengue virus blocking and fitness.	The dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses are transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti and pose a substantial threat to global public health. Current vaccines and mosquito control strategies have limited efficacy, so novel interventions are needed1,2. Wolbachia are bacteria that inhabit insect cells and have been found to reduce viral infection-a phenotype that is referred to as viral 'blocking'3. Although not naturally found in A. aegypti4, Wolbachia were stably introduced into this mosquito in 20114,5 and were shown to reduce the transmission potential of dengue, Zika and chikungunya6,7. Subsequent field trials showed Wolbachia's ability to spread through A. aegypti populations and reduce the local incidence of dengue fever8. Despite these successes, the evolutionary stability of viral blocking is unknown. Here, we utilized artificial selection to reveal genetic variation in the mosquito that affects Wolbachia-mediated dengue blocking. We found that mosquitoes exhibiting weaker blocking also have reduced fitness, suggesting the potential for natural selection to maintain blocking. We also identified A. aegypti genes that affect blocking strength, shedding light on a possible mechanism for the trait. These results will inform the use of Wolbachia as biocontrol agents against mosquito-borne viruses and direct further research into measuring and improving their efficacy. <br>	1199	209	13
Combination of Modified NS1 and NS3 as a Novel Vaccine Strategy against Dengue Virus Infection.	Dengue virus (DENV) causes a range of illness, including dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. DENV nonstructural protein (NS) 1 has been considered to be a desirable vaccine candidate for its ability to induce Ab and complement-dependent cytolysis of DENV-infected cells as well as to block the pathogenic effects of NS1. However a potential drawback of NS1 as a vaccine is that anti-DENV NS1 Abs can lead to endothelial cell damage and platelet dysfunction by antigenic cross-reactivity. Therefore, we modified the DENV NS1 by replacing the C-terminal cross-reactive epitopes with the corresponding region of Japanese encephalitis virus NS1 to generate a chimeric DJ NS1 protein. Active immunization with DJ NS1 induced a strong Ab response. To enhance cellular immunity, we further combined DJ NS1 with DENV NS3 to immunize mice and showed activation of Ag-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in addition to Ab responses. We further detected NS3-specific CTL activities as well as CD107a expression of effector cells. Importantly, the protective effects attributed by DJ NS1 and NS3 immunization were demonstrated in a DENV-infected mouse model by reduced viral titers, soluble NS1 levels, mouse tail bleeding time, and vascular leakage at skin injection sites. Collectively, the results from this study reveal the humoral and cellular immune responses and the protective effects conferred by DJ NS1 and NS3 immunization in the mouse model of DENV infection and provide a potential strategy for dengue vaccine design. <br>	1312	249	9
Dengue vascular leak syndrome: insights into potentially new treatment modalities.	Dengue viruses (DENV) are the most common cause of mosquito-borne viral illness in the world, affecting approximately 400 million people annually. Symptomatic illness ranges from a mild, self-limiting febrile illness to one manifested by plasma leakage that can lead to vascular collapse and death. In this issue of the JCI, Rathore et al. report that DENV can cause mast cell degranulation independently of mast cell infection, resulting in the release of the vasoactive mediators chymase and tryptase. The authors showed that recombinant chymase and tryptase increased endothelial permeability in a dose-dependent manner in human microvascular endothelial cells. They went on to evaluate the tryptase inhibitor nafamostat mesylate in a mouse model for severe DENV viremia. Strikingly, the potential therapeutic prevented and reversed the tryptase-induced vascular permeability. As there are currently no licensed drugs for the treatment of dengue, these findings present a possible treatment modality for severe disease. <br>	880	154	8
Recent advances in understanding dengue.	This is a selective review of recent publications on dengue clinical features, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and vaccine development placed in a context of observations made over the past half century. Four dengue viruses (DENVs) are transmitted by urban cycle mosquitoes causing diseases whose nature and severity are influenced by interacting factors such as virus, age, immune status of the host, and human genetic variability. A phenomenon that controls the kinetics of DENV infection, antibody-dependent enhancement, best explains the correlation of the vascular permeability syndrome with second heterotypic DENV infections and infection in the presence of passively acquired antibodies. Based on growing evidence in vivo and in vitro, the tissue-damaging DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is responsible for most of the pathophysiological features of severe dengue. This review considers the contribution of hemophagocytic histiocytosis syndrome to cases of severe dengue, the role of movement of humans in dengue epidemiology, and modeling and planning control programs and describes a country-wide survey for dengue infections in Bangladesh and efforts to learn what controls the clinical outcome of dengue infections. Progress and problems with three tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are reviewed. Several research mysteries remain: why is the risk of severe disease during second heterotypic DENV infection so low, why is the onset of vascular permeability correlated with defervescence, and what are the crucial components of protective immunity? <br>	1346	229	7
Feasibility of case-control and test-negative designs to evaluate dengue vaccine effectiveness in Malaysia.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe world's first dengue vaccine [Dengvaxia; Sanofi Pasteur] was licensed in 2015 and others are in development. Real-world evaluations of dengue vaccines will therefore soon be needed. We assessed feasibility of case control (CC) and test-negative (TN) design studies for dengue vaccine effectiveness by measuring associations between socio-demographic risk factors, and hospitalized dengue outcomes, in Malaysia. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFollowing ethical approval, we conducted hospital-based dengue surveillance for one year in three referral hospitals. Suspected cases aged 9-25 years underwent dengue virological confirmation by RT-PCR and/or NS1 Ag ELISA at a central laboratory. Two age- and geography-matched hospitalized non-dengue case-controls were recruited for a traditional CC study. Suspected cases testing negative were test-negative controls. Socio-demographic, risk factor and routine laboratory data were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between confirmed dengue and risk factors. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe recruited 327 subjects; 155 were suspected of dengue. The planned sample size was not met. 124 (80%) of suspected cases were dengue-confirmed; seven were assessed as severe. Three had missing RT-PCR results; the study recruited 28 test-negative controls. Only 172 matched controls could be recruited; 90 cases were matched with ≥1 controls. Characteristics of cases and controls were mostly similar. By CC design, two variables were significant risk factors for hospitalized dengue: recent household dengue contact (OR: 54, 95% CI: 7.3-397) and recent neighbourhood insecticidal fogging (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3-3.6). In the TN design, no risk factors were identified. In comparison with gold-standard diagnostics, routine tests performed poorly. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe CC design may be more appropriate than the TN design for hospitalized dengue vaccine effectiveness studies. Selection bias in case control selection could be minimized by protocol changes more easily than increasing TN design control numbers, because early-stage dengue diagnosis in endemic countries is highly specific.

Spatial and temporal patterns of dengue incidence in northeastern Thailand 2006-2016.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue, a viral disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, is an important public health concern throughout Thailand. Climate variables are potential predictors of dengue transmission. Associations between climate variables and dengue have usually been performed on large-scale first-level national administrative divisions, i.e. provinces. Here we analyze data on a finer spatial resolution in one province, which is often more relevant for effective disease control design. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of seasonal variations, monthly climate variability, and to identify local clusters of symptomatic disease at the sub-district level based on reported dengue cases. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspData on dengue cases were retrieved from the national communicable disease surveillance system in Thailand. Between 2006 and 2016, 15,167 cases were recorded in 199 sub-districts of Khon Kaen Province, northeastern Thailand. Descriptive analyses included demographic characteristics and temporal patterns of disease and climate variables. The association between monthly disease incidence and climate variations was analyzed at the sub-district level using Bayesian Poisson spatial regression. A hotspot analysis was used to assess the spatial patterns (clustered/dispersed/random) of dengue incidence. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue was predominant in the 5-14 year-old age group (51.1%). However, over time, dengue incidence in the older age groups (> 15 years) gradually increased and was the most affected group in 2013. Dengue outbreaks coincide with the rainy season. In the spatial regression model, maximum temperature was associated with higher incidence. The hotspot analysis showed clustering of cases around the urbanized area of Khon Kaen city and in rural areas in the southwestern portion of the province. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere was an increase in the number of reported dengue cases in older age groups over the study period. Dengue incidence was highly seasonal and positively associated with maximum ambient temperature. However, climatic variables did not explain all the spatial variation of dengue in the province. Further analyses are needed to clarify the detailed effects of urbanization and other potential environmental risk factors. These results provide useful information for ongoing prediction modeling and developing of dengue early warning systems to guide vector control operations. <br>	2038	984	19
Entomological assessment of dengue virus transmission risk in three urban areas of Kenya.	Urbanization is one of the major drivers of dengue epidemics globally. In Kenya, an intriguing pattern of urban dengue virus epidemics has been documented in which recurrent epidemics are reported from the coastal city of Mombasa, whereas no outbreaks occur in the two major inland cities of Kisumu and Nairobi. In an attempt to understand the entomological risk factors underlying the observed urban dengue epidemic pattern in Kenya, we evaluated vector density, human feeding patterns, vector genetics, and prevailing environmental temperature to establish how these may interact with one another to shape the disease transmission pattern. We determined that (i) Nairobi and Kisumu had lower vector density and human blood indices, respectively, than Mombasa, (ii) vector competence for dengue-2 virus was comparable among Ae. aegypti populations from the three cities, with no discernible association between susceptibility and vector cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene variation, and (iii) vector competence was temperature-dependent. Our study suggests that lower temperature and Ae. aegypti vector density in Nairobi may be responsible for the absence of dengue outbreaks in the capital city, whereas differences in feeding behavior, but not vector competence, temperature, or vector density, contribute in part to the observed recurrent dengue epidemics in coastal Mombasa compared to Kisumu. <br>	1201	209	7
Flavonoids as efficient scaffolds: Recent trends for malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue.	Endemic in 149 tropical and subtropical countries, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect more than 1 billion people annually with over 500,000 deaths. Among the NTDs, some of the most severe consist of leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. The impact of the combined NTDs closely rivals that of malaria. According to the World Health Organization, 216 million cases of malaria were reported in 2016 with 445,000 deaths. Current treatment options are associated with various limitations including widespread drug resistance, severe adverse effects, lengthy treatment duration, unfavorable toxicity profiles, and complicated drug administration procedures. Flavonoids are a class of compounds that has been the subject of considerable scientific interest. New developments of flavonoids have made promising advances for the potential treatment of malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue, with less toxicity, high efficacy, and improved bioavailability. This review summarizes the current standings of the use of flavonoids to treat malaria and neglected diseases such as leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. Natural and synthetic flavonoids are leading compounds that can be used for developing antiprotozoal and antiviral agents. However, detailed studies on toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action of these compounds are required to confirm the in vitro pharmacological claims of flavonoids for pharmaceutical applications. HIGHLIGHTS: In the current review, we have tried to compile recent discoveries on natural and synthetic flavonoids as well as their implication in the treatment of malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. A total of 373 (220 natural and 153 synthetic) flavonoids have been evaluated for antimalarial, antileishmanial, antichagasic, and antidengue activities. Most of these flavonoids showed promising results against the above diseases. Reports on molecular modeling of flavonoid compounds to the disease target indicated encouraging results. Flavonoids can be prospected as potential leads for drug development; however, more rigorously designed studies on toxicity and pharmacokinetics, as well as the quantitative structure-activity relationship studies of these compounds, need to be addressed. <br>	1965	318	15
Assays with recombinant soluble isoforms of DC-SIGN, a dengue virus ligand, show variation in their ability to bind to mannose residues.	The DC-SIGN glycoprotein is responsible for the initial adhesion of dengue virus (DENV) to immune cells by the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). There are thirteen soluble and membrane-bound DC-SIGN isoforms, but the role of soluble isoforms in the DENV internalization process is not known. Five isoforms with an altered or absent CRD were identified, and three different soluble isoforms were used to confirm the interactions with mannose residues. The results show the loss of binding ability of one soluble isoform and binding ability of two of them. All of them will be used to verify their role in the DENV internalization process. <br>	546	107	5
Evaluation of commercially available three dengue rapid diagnostic test kits for diagnosis of acute dengue virus infection at the point-of-care setting in Myanmar.	Early and accurate diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV) infection is very important and Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) Kits are been used as a point-of-care test to check DENV infection. A Hospital and Laboratory-based descriptive study was conducted at 550-bedded Mandalay Children Hospital in 2018. Acute-phase serum samples were collected from 202 dengue suspected patients to evaluate the efficacy of RDT Kits for the diagnosis of DENV infection. Commercially available three test kits which include: ((i) CareUs Dengue Combo, Korea, (ii) Humasis Dengue Combo, Korea and (iii) Wondfo Dengue Combo, China) were validated against WHO-based reference standard tests. 140/202 patients (69.3%) was confirmed to have DENV infection. All four serotypes of dengue viruses (57 DENV-1, 7 DENV-2, 6 DENV-3 and 10 DENV-4) were identified from 80 dengue confirmed patients and DENV-1 was the dominant serotype. Combining the NS-1 antigen and IgM antibody results from the CareUs Dengue Combo Kit gave the best sensitivity (92.1%, 95% CI 86.4%-96.0%) and specificity (75.8%, 95%CI 63.3%-85.8%). Among the three RDT Kits, the performance of CareUS Kit was better than the other two. This study explored the evidence of the usefulness of RDT Kits at the point-of-care setting for diagnosis of acute dengue infection. <br>	1105	225	8
Epidemiology of Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika Virus Disease in the U.S. States and Territories, 2017.	Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, primarily transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes, have caused large outbreaks in the Americas, leading to travel-associated cases and local mosquito-borne transmission in the United States. We describe the epidemiology of dengue, chikungunya, and noncongenital Zika virus disease cases reported from U.S. states and territories in 2017, including 971 dengue cases, 195 chikungunya cases, and 1,118 Zika virus disease cases. Cases of all three diseases reported from the territories were reported as resulting from local mosquito-borne transmission. Cases reported from the states were primarily among travelers, with only seven locally acquired mosquito-transmitted Zika virus disease cases reported from Texas (n = 5) and Florida (n = 2). In the territories, most dengue cases (n = 508, 98%) were reported from American Samoa, whereas the majority of chikungunya (n = 39, 100%) and Zika virus disease (n = 620, 93%) cases were reported from Puerto Rico. Temporally, the highest number of Zika virus disease cases occurred at the beginning of the year, followed by a sharp decline, mirroring decreasing case numbers across the Americas following large outbreaks in 2015 and 2016. Dengue and chikungunya cases followed a more seasonal pattern, with higher case numbers from July through September. Travelers to the United States and residents of areas with active virus transmission should be informed of both the ongoing risk from dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus disease and personal protective measures to lower their risk of mosquito bites and to help prevent the spread of these diseases. <br>	1392	252	7
Dengue: Uncommon Neurological Presentations of a Common Tropical Illness.	Dengue is a common arthropod-borne flavivirus and commonly manifests as fever, bleeding diathesis, and capillary leak syndrome. Neurological manifestations are uncommon except for encephalopathy. We have recently had the opportunity of observing two patients with rare neurological complications of dengue, transverse myelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Both the cases had good neurological recovery with steroid and intravenous immunoglobulin, respectively. How to cite this article: Singh H, Pannu AK, Bhalla A, Suri V, Kumari S.

Clinical Profile and Outcome of Dengue Fever in Multidisciplinary Intensive Care Unit of a Tertiary Level Hospital in India.	<b>Background:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIndia is one of the seven identified countries in South-East Asia region regularly reporting dengue fever (DF)/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) outbreaks. Even though the dengue prodrome and evolution of illness are most often similar in many patients, progress and outcome may differ significantly depending on the severity of illness as well as treatment instituted. We studied the clinical manifestations, outcome and factors predicting mortality of serology confirmed dengue fever cases admitted in Multidisciplinary Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of a high acuity healthcare facility in India. <br><b>Methodology:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll patients with serology proven dengue fever admitted to MICU between 1st July 2015 and1st December 2015 were included in the study. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, severity of illness scores and outcome were recorded. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMajority of the patients (58.4%) belonged to 21-40 year age group. Hepatic (96.8%) followed by hematological (79.2%) involvement were the most common findings. CNS involvement observed among 27%. Survival to hospital discharge was 78.9%. Respiratory and gastrointestinal system involvement was associated with increased mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI) and shock were the clinical syndromes associated with mortality. Serum lactate, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were significantly elevated among non survivors. Significant difference in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) scores was also observed among survivors and non survivors. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOrgan system involvement and higher disease severity scores are strong predictors of mortality. High index of suspicion for atypical manifestations of dengue is warranted. <br><b>How to cite this article:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPadyana M, Karanth S, Vaidya S, Gopaldas JA.

Molecular Epidemiology of Dengue in Panama: 25 Years of Circulation.	Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arbovirus in terms of human public health importance globally. In addition to DENV epidemiological surveillance, genomic surveillance may help investigators understand the epidemiological dynamics, geographic distribution, and temporal patterns of DENV circulation. Herein, we aimed to reconstruct the molecular epidemiology and phylogeny of DENV in Panama to connect the epidemiological history of DENV dispersal and circulation in Latin America. We retrospectively analyzed the epidemiological data obtained during 25 years of DENV surveillance in Panama. DENV was reintroduced in Panama in 1993 after a 35 year absence of autochthonous transmission. The increase in the number of total dengue cases has been accompanied by an increase in severe and fatal cases, with the highest case fatality rate recorded in 2011. All four serotypes were detected in Panama, which is characterized by serotype replacement and/or co-circulation of multiple serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of datasets collected from envelope (E) gene sequences obtained from viruses isolated from human sera demonstrated that circulating viruses were highly diverse and clustered in distinct clades, with co-circulation of clades from the same genotype. Our analyses also suggest that Panamanian strains were related to viruses from different regions of the Americas, suggesting a continuous exchange of viruses within the Americas. <br>	1245	211	8
Epidemiological profile of Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya virus infections identified by medical and molecular evaluations in Rondonia, Brazil.	Several arboviruses have emerged and/or re-emerged in North, Central and South-American countries. Viruses from some regions of Africa and Asia, such as the Zika and Chikungunya virus have been introduced in new continents causing major public health problems. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RNA from Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in symptomatic patients from Rondonia, where the epidemiological profile is still little known, by one-step real-time RT-PCR. The main clinical signs and symtoms were fever (51.2%), headache (78%), chills (6.1%), pruritus (12.2%), exanthema (20.1%), arthralgia (35.3%), myalgia (26.8%) and retro-orbital pain (19.5%). Serum from 164 symptomatic patients were collected and tested for RNA of Zika, Dengue types 1 to 4 and Chikungunya viruses, in addition to antibodies against Dengue NS1 antigen. Direct microscopy for Malaria was also performed. Only ZIKV RNA was detected in 4.3% of the patients, and in the remaining 95.7% of the patients RNA for Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses were not detected. This finding is intriguing as the region has been endemic for Dengue for a long time and more recently for Chikungunya virus as well. The results indicated that medical and molecular parameters obtained were suitable to describe the first report of symptomatic Zika infections in this region. Furthermore, the low rate of detection, compared to clinical signs and symptoms as the solely diagnosis criteria, suggests that molecular assays for detection of viruses or other pathogens that cause similar symptoms should be used and the corresponding diseases could be included in the compulsory notification list. <br>	1429	274	10
Serostatus testing and dengue vaccine cost-benefit thresholds.	The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends pre-screening for past infection prior to administration of the only licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV. Using a threshold modelling analysis, we identify settings where this guidance prohibits positive net-benefits, and are thus unfavourable. Generally, however, our model shows test-then-vaccinate strategies can improve CYD-TDV economic viability: effective testing reduces unnecessary vaccination costs while increasing health benefits. With sufficiently low testing cost, those trends outweigh additional screening costs, expanding the range of settings with positive net-benefits. This work highlights two aspects for further analysis of test-then-vaccinate strategies. We found that starting routine testing at younger ages could increase benefits; if real tests are shown to sufficiently address safety concerns, the manufacturer, regulators and WHO should revisit guidance restricting use to 9-years-and-older recipients. We also found that repeat testing could improve return-on-investment (ROI), despite increasing intervention costs. Thus, more detailed analyses should address questions on repeat testing and testing periodicity, in addition to real test sensitivity and specificity. Our results follow from a mathematical model relating ROI to epidemiology, intervention strategy, and costs for testing, vaccination and dengue infections. We applied this model to a range of strategies, costs and epidemiological settings pertinent to CYD-TDV. However, general trends may not apply locally, so we provide our model and analyses as an R package available via CRAN, denvax. To apply to their setting, decision-makers need only local estimates of age-specific seroprevalence and costs for secondary infections. <br>	1544	257	12

Assessment of the new World Health Organization's dengue classification for predicting severity of illness and level of healthcare required.	The objective of this study was to assess the validity of the new dengue classification proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009 and to develop pragmatic guidelines for case triage and management. This retrospective study involved 357 laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue infection diagnosed at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia over a 4-year period from 2014 to 2017. The sensitivity of the new classification for identifying severe cases was limited (65%) but higher than the old one (30%). It had a higher sensitivity for identifying patients who needed advanced healthcare compared to the old one (72% versus 32%, respectively). We propose adding decompensation of chronic diseases and thrombocytopenia-related bleeding to the category of severe dengue in the new classification. This modification improves sensitivity from 72% to 98% for identifying patients who need advanced healthcare without altering specificity (97%). It also improves sensitivity in predicting severe outcomes from 32% to 88%. In conclusion, the new classification had a low sensitivity for identifying patients needing advanced care and for predicting morbidity and mortality. We propose to include decompensation of chronic diseases and thrombocytopenia-related bleeding to the category of severe dengue in the new classification to improve the sensitivity of predicting cases requiring advanced care. <br>	1220	211	8
Micronutrients, immunological parameters, and dengue virus infection in coastal Ecuador: A nested case-control study in an infectious disease surveillance program.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMicronutrients are known to modulate host immunity and there is limited literature on this association in the context of dengue virus infection (DENV). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing a nested case-control design in a surveillance program, we measured anthropometry; nutritional biomarkers including serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, retinol-binding protein (RBP), 25-hydroxy vitamin D, folate, and vitamin B12; and a panel of immune response markers and compared these measures across four illness categories: healthy control, non-febrile DENV, other febrile illness (OFI), and apparent DENV using multivariate polytomous logistic regression models. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAmong 142 participants, serum ferritin (ng/mL) was associated with apparent DENV compared to healthy controls (OR 2.66; CI 1.53, 4.62; p=0.001), and RBP concentrations (µmol/L) were associated with apparent DENV (OR 0.03; CI 0.00, 0.30; p=0.003) and OFI (OR 0.02; CI 0.00, 0.24; p=0.003). In a subset of 71 participants, IL-15 levels (MFI) were positively associated with apparent DENV (OR 1.09; CI 1.03, 1.14; p=0.001) and negatively associated with non-febrile DENV (OR 0.89; CI 0.80, 0.99; p=0.03) compared to healthy controls. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter adjusting for the acute phase response, serum ferritin and RBP concentrations were associated with apparent DENV and may represent biomarkers of clinical importance in the context of dengue illness. <br>	1181	624	5
A Rare Case of Pituitary Apoplexy Secondary to Dengue Fever-induced Thrombocytopenia.	Pituitary apoplexy (PA) is an endocrine emergency resulting from hemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary tumor or non-tumorous pituitary gland. The most important predisposing factors for PA are cerebral angiographic procedures, systemic hypertension, surgeries, head injury, coagulopathies, and drugs. Thrombocytopenia is a risk factor for PA. Dengue fever causes thrombocytopenia and there are reported cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever predisposing to PA. But there are no reported cases of dengue fever per se predisposing to PA, and we report such a case in an 85-year-old elderly male who presented with features suggestive of a hypertensive emergency and, on evaluation, was found to have a pituitary incidentaloma and dengue fever. During the hospital course, he developed acute IIIrd nerve palsy and, when evaluated, was found to have PA. He responded well to medical management with steroids and thyroxine. Prompt initiation of treatment is of utmost importance in pituitary apoplexy, as it can result in adverse events, including loss of vision and even death from hemodynamic compromise. <br>	944	170	8
Concomitant dengue fever in Varicella zoster infection - A rare presentation.	Varicella zoster infection is one of the self-limiting viral infections during childhood and dengue fever is an endemic infection in Malaysia, which commonly occurs in the form of nonspecific febrile illness at the initial stage. It is rare for the two viral infections to occur simultaneously. A case of dengue fever without warning sign in a five-year old girl was reported, with early symptoms of fever and vesicular rashes. She was clinically diagnosed with varicella zoster infection during the first visit. Surprisingly, she remained febrile even on day six of illness despite no new vesicular lesions on her skin. Due to suspicion of another infection, follow-up investigation was done and revealed isolated thrombocytopenia. This finding was confirmed with positive NS1Ag. A case of rare dengue fever concomitant with varicella zoster infection was reported. <br>	739	138	8
Molecular studies on dengue viruses detected in patients from Central India.	<b>Purpose:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue viruses (DENVs), the causative agents of dengue (DEN), are classified into four serotypes and several genotypes. Identifying circulating serotypes and genotypes has clinical and epidemiological importance; however, limited information in this regard is available from Central India. This laboratory-based study was done to fill this lacuna. <br><b>Materials and Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe samples collected in the acute phase of illness were subjected to DEN NS1 ELISA, and NS1-positive samples (n = 80) were subjected to serotyping; representative samples from each serotype were sequenced to identify genotypes. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeventy-one (88.75%) samples could be serotyped. All the four DENV serotypes with dominance of DENV-3 (n = 33; 47%) were detected. DENV-4 was detected after a gap of 3 years. Cases with multiple DENV serotype infection were identified. Genotyping showed that DENV-1 belonging to genotype III, DENV-2 cosmopolitan (IV), DENV-3 genotype III lineage C and DENV-4 genotype I were in circulation in the year 2016. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur study documents the molecular characteristics of DENV circulating in the area. Detection of heterologous DENV serotype with dominance of DENV-3 emphasises the need for regular molecular monitoring. <br>	1017	560	10
Severe dengue in travellers: pathogenesis, risk and clinical management.	Rationale for review: Dengue is a frequent cause of febrile illness among travellers and has overtaken malaria as the leading cause of febrile illness for those traveling to South East Asia. The purpose is to review the risk of dengue and severe dengue in travellers with a particular focus on the pathogenesis and clinical management of severe dengue. Risk, pathogenesis and clinical management: The risk of travel-acquired dengue depends on destination, season and duration of travel and activities during travel. Seroconversion rates reported in travellers therefore vary between less than 1% to more than 20%. The most common life-threatening clinical response to dengue infection is the dengue vascular permeability syndrome, epidemiologically linked to secondary infection, but can also occur in primary infection. Tertiary and quaternary infections are usually associated with mild or no disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement, viral factors, age, host factors, and clinical experience of the managing physician modulate the risk of progressing to severe dengue. The relative risk of severe dengue in secondary versus primary infection ranges from 2 to 7. The absolute risk of severe dengue in highly endemic areas in children is about 0.1% per year for primary infections, and 0.4% for secondary infections. About 2-4% of secondary infections lead to severe dengue. Severe dengue and death are both relatively rare in general travellers, but more frequently in those visiting friends and relatives (VFR). Clinical management of severe dengue depends on judicious use of fluid rehydration. Conclusions: Although dengue is a frequent cause of travel illness, severe dengue and deaths are rare. Nevertheless, dengue infections can interrupt travel, lead to evacuation and major out-of-pocket costs. Dengue is more frequent than many other travel-related vaccine preventable diseases such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, indicating a need for a dengue vaccine for travellers. <br>	1732	311	15
Dengue with Hemorrhagic Manifestations and Acute Pancreatitis: Case Report and Review.	Dengue fever is an acute viral disease transmitted by arthropods, which has become a major public health problem, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. We found 17 reported cases of dengue complicated with pancreatitis in the world literature, 13 cases were found in Asia, one in Europe, and two in Latin America. This is the first and an unusual case of dengue with hemorrhagic manifestations complicated with acute pancreatitis in Panama. A 37-year-old woman with an unknown past medical history presented to Santo Tomas Hospital (Panama City, Panama) with sudden abdominal pain in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium, described as a burning-like pain radiating towards the back. Five days before the admission, the patient had fever, chills, headache, retro-orbital pain, dizziness, arthralgia, loss of appetite, and fatigue. In the emergency room, a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made and the patient was hospitalized. Physical examination showed bleeding gums, and laboratory tests show leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which suggested an infection caused by the dengue virus. The dengue infection was confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The patient received supportive treatment and the symptoms resolved. She was discharged on the ninth day of hospitalization without any sequela. The final diagnosis was hemorrhagic dengue complicated by acute pancreatitis. <br>	1250	218	11

Small molecule grp94 inhibitors block dengue and Zika virus replication.	Two major flaviviruses, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), cause severe health and economic burdens worldwide. Recently, genome-wide screenings have uncovered the importance of regulators of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway for flavivirus replication in host cells. Here we report the identification of the compound Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-me) as a potent inhibitor of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase-mediated ERAD, which possesses a broad-spectrum activity against both DENV and ZIKV. Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) suggested that CDDO-me binds to grp94, a key component of the Hrd1 pathway, at a low nanomolar concentration, whereas interaction was not detected with its paralog Hsp90. CDDO-me and the grp94 inhibitor PU-WS13 substantially suppressed DENV2 replication and the cytopathic effects caused by DENV and ZIKV infection. The antiviral activities of both compounds were demonstrated for all four DENV serotypes and four ZIKV strains in multiple human cell lines. This study defines grp94 as a crucial host factor for flavivirus replication and identified CDDO-me as a potent small molecule inhibitor of flavivirus infection. Inhibition of grp94 may contribute to the antiviral activity of CDDO-me. Further investigation of grp94 inhibitors may lead to a new class of broad-spectrum anti-flaviviral medications. <br>	1205	213	8
Antiviral activity of ST081006 against the dengue virus.	Dengue virus, the causative agent for the dengue fever, infects approximately 50-100 million people worldwide per year. The high incidence of dengue fever, along with its potential to develop into a severe, life-threatening form, resulted in great interest in the discovery of an antiviral against it. In this study, we constructed a DENV2-EGFP infectious clone, established a fluorescence-based, high-throughput screening platform, and conducted a screen for anti-DENV compounds on a flavonoid-derivative library, Amongst the hits identified, ST081006 was found to be a strong inhibitor of the DENV replication. Time-course studies suggest that the presence of ST081006 is necessary to inhibit successive rounds of virus replication. Further investigations demonstrated that ST081006 affects the synthesis of both viral protein and viral RNA, and one anti-DENV mechanism is the direct inhibition of viral protein synthesis. The replication of all dengue serotypes, along with that of the enterovirus EV-A71, was shown to be affected by ST081006. Attempts to generate ST081006-resistant DENV were unsuccessful, and thus hints at host factors as potential drug target. Together, these results suggest that ST081006 affect DENV replication, likely by acting on a target involved in the viral protein and/or RNA synthesis pathway. <br>	1140	207	7
Assessing the Diversity and Stability of Cellular Immunity Generated in Response to the Candidate Live-Attenuated Dengue Virus Vaccine TAK-003.	The development of an efficacious DENV vaccine has been a long-standing public health priority. However, this effort has been complicated significantly due to the hazard presented by incomplete humoral immunity in mediating immune enhancement of infection and disease severity. Therefore, there is a significant need for DENV vaccine platforms capable of generating broad immune responses including durable cellular immunity, as well as novel analytical tools to assess the magnitude, diversity, and persistence of vaccine-elicited immunity. In this study, we demonstrate that a single dose of the recombinant, tetravalent, live-attenuated DENV vaccine TAK-003 elicits potent and durable cellular immunity against both the structural and non-structural proteins of all four DENV serotypes, which is maintained for at least 4 months post-immunization. Although not contained within the vaccine formulation, significant reactivity against the non-structural (NS) proteins of DENV-1,-3, and-4 is observed following vaccination, to an extent directly proportional to the magnitude of responses to the corresponding vaccine (DENV-2) components. Distinct, quantifiable, and durable patterns of DENV antigen reactivity can be observed in individuals following vaccination. Detailed epitope mapping of T cell reactivity against the DENV-2 proteome using a matrix of overlapping peptide pools demonstrated that TAK-003 elicits a broad response directed across the DENV-2 proteome, with focused reactivity against NS1 and NS3. We conclude that, as measured by an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay, a single dose of TAK-003 generates potent T cell-mediated immunity which is durable in magnitude and breadth through 4 months post-vaccination. <br>	1483	260	8
Evaluation of novel rapid detection kits for dengue virus NS1 antigen in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2017.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the biggest challenges for human health in the world. In addition, a secondary DENV infection sometimes causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which frequently leads to death. For this reason, accurate diagnosis record management is useful for prediction of DHF. Therefore, the demand for DENV rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) is increasing because these tests are easy and rapid to use. However, commercially available RDTs often show low sensitivity for DENV and cross-reactivity against other flaviviruses, especially Zika virus (ZIKV). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe developed two types of novel DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) detection RDTs, designated TKK-1st and TKK-2nd kits. Specificities of the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used in these kits were confirmed by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), dot blot, and western blot using recombinant NS1 proteins and synthetic peptides. For evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the novel DENV NS1 RDTs, we first used cultured DENV and other flaviviruses, ZIKV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). We then used clinical specimens obtained in Bangladesh in 2017 for further evaluation of kit sensitivity and specificity in comparison with commercially available RDTs. In addition, RNA extracted from sera were used for viral genome sequencing and genotyping. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEpitopes of three out of four MAbs used in the two novel RDTs were located in amino acid positions 100 to 122 in the NS1 protein, a region that shows low levels of homology with other flaviviruses. Our new kits showed high levels of sensitivity against various serotypes and genotypes of DENV and exhibited high levels of specificity without cross-reactivity against ZIKV and JEV. In clinical specimens, our RDTs showed sensitivities of 96.0% (145/151, TKK-1st kit) and 96.7% (146/151, TKK-2nd kit), and specificities of 98.0% (98/100, TKK-1st kit and TKK-2nd kit). On the other hand, in the case of the commercially available SD Bioline RDT, sensitivity was 83.4% (126/151) and specificity was 99.0% (99/100) against the same clinical specimens. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur novel DENV NS1-targeting RDTs demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and lacked cross-reactivity against ZIKV and JEV compared with commercially available RDTs. <br>	1938	1074	15
Unusual clinical manifestations of dengue disease - Real or imagined?	The disease caused by each of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) have plagued humans since last century. Symptoms of dengue virus (DENV) infection range from asymptomatic to dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue disease (SDD). One third of the world's population lives in regions with active urban DENV transmission, and thousands of serologically naïve travelers visit these areas annually, making a significant portion of the human population at risk of being infected. Even though lifelong immunity to the homotypic serotype is achieved after a primary DENV infection. Heterotypic DENV infections may be exacerbated by a pre-existing immune memory to the primary infection and can result in an increased probability of severe disease. Not only, age, comorbidities and presence of antibodies transferred passively from dengue-immune mother to infants are considered risk factors to dengue severe forms. Plasma leakage and multiple organ impairment are well documented in the literature, affecting liver, lung, brain, muscle, and kidney. However, unusual manifestation, severe or not, have been reported and may require medical attention. This review will summarize and discuss the increasing reports of unusual manifestations in the clinical course of dengue infection. <br>	1092	194	9
Phylogenetic analysis revealed the co-circulation of four dengue virus serotypes in Southern Thailand.	Dengue fever is caused by dengue viruses (DENV) from the Flavivirus genus and is the most prevalent arboviral disease. DENV exists in four immunogenically distinct and genetically-related serotypes (DENV-1 to 4), each subdivided in genotypes. Despite the endemicity of all four DENV serotypes in Thailand, no prior study has characterized the circulation of DENV in the southern provinces of the country. To determine the genetic diversity of DENV circulating in Southern Thailand in 2015 and 2016, we investigated 46 viruses from 182 patients' sera confirmed positive for DENV by serological and Nested RT-PCR tests. Our dataset included 2 DENV-1, 20 DENV-2, 9 DENV-3 and 15 DENV-4. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on viral envelop sequences. This revealed that part of the identified genotypes from DENV-1 and DENV-4 had been predominant in Asia (genotype I for both serotypes), while genotype II for DENV-4 and the Cosmopolitan genotype DENV-2 were also circulating. Whereas DENV-3 genotype II had been predominantly detected in South East Asia during the previous decades, we found genotype III and genotype I in Southern Thailand. All DENV genotype identified in this study were closely related to contemporary strains circulating in Southeast Asian countries, emphasizing the regional circulation of DENV. These results provide new insights into the co-circulation of all four DENV serotypes in Southern Thailand, confirming the hyperendemicity of DENV in the region. These findings also suggest a new trend of dissemination for some DENV serotypes with a possible shift in genotype distribution; as recently observed in other Asian countries. <br>	1409	265	11
Incidence dynamics and investigation of key interventions in a dengue outbreak in Ningbo City, China.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe reported incidence of dengue fever increased dramatically in recent years in China. This study aimed to investigate and to assess the effectiveness of intervention implemented in a dengue outbreak in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspData of a dengue outbreak were collected in Ningbo City in China by a field epidemiological survey according to a strict protocol and case definition. Serum specimens of all cases were collected for diagnosis and the virological characteristics were detected by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequencing. Vector surveillance was implemented during the outbreak to collect the larva and adult mosquito densities to calculate the Breteau Index (BI) and human biting rate (HBR), respectively. Data of monthly BI and light-trap density in 2018 were built to calculate the seasonality of the vector. A transmission mathematical model was developed to dynamic the incidence of the disease. The parameters of the model were estimated by the data of the outbreak and vector surveillance data in 2018. The effectiveness of the interventions implemented during the outbreak was assessed by the data and the modelling. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom 11 August to 8 September, 2018, a dengue outbreak was reported with 27 confirmed cases in a population of 5536-people community (community A) of Ningbo City. Whole E gene sequences were obtained from 24 cases and were confirmed as dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1). The transmission source of the outbreak was origin from community B where a dengue case having the same E gene sequence was onset on 30 July. Aedes albopictus was the only vector species in the area. The value of BI and HBR was 57.5 and 12 per person per hour respectively on 18 August, 2018 and decreased dramatically after interventions. The transmission model fitted well (χ2 = 6.324, P = 0.388) with the reported cases data. With no intervention, the total simulated number of the cases would be 1728 with a total attack rate (TAR) of 31.21% (95%CI: 29.99%- 32.43%). Case isolation and larva control (LC) have almost the same TAR and duration of outbreak (DO) as no intervention. Different levels of reducing HBR (rHBR) had different effectiveness with TARs ranging from 1.05% to 31.21% and DOs ranging from 27 days to 102 days. Adult vector control (AVC) had a very low TAR and DO. "LC+AVC" had a similar TAR and DO as that of AVC. "rHBR100%+LC", "rHBR100%+AVC", "rHBR100%+LC+AVC" and "rHBR100%+LC+AVC+Iso" had the same effectiveness. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWithout intervention, DENV-1 could be transmitted rapidly within a short period of time and leads to high attack rate in community in China. AVC or rHBR should be recommended as primary interventions to control rapid transmission of the dengue virus at the early stage of an outbreak. <br>	2316	1182	22
[Travel Related Fever and Rash: Two Cases of Dengue Fever].	The frequency of travel-related infections in the world has increased due to the easily and widespread use of travel facilities in the 21st century. Vector-borne diseases are an important part of infectious diseases. Dengue fever is one of the travel-related infections that has been reported increasingly in recent years through the development of diagnostic methods. The aim of this report was to present two Dengue fever cases originating from travel. There was a story of mosquito bite during a trip to Sri Lanka travel in our first case. The patient was 30 years old and maculopapular rash appeared on the fifth day of contact. Three days after the onset of the rash, she has admitted to our clinic, complaining with fever and chills. Increased leukopenia and muscle enzymes were detected in the laboratory analysis. Real-time reverse transcriptase polimerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive in the serum sample. The patient was followed up with supportive care and discharged by improvement. The second case, a 24-year-old male, had a story of mosquito bite during his trip to Malaysia. After the patient complained of fever, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting and muscle pain, the Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen test performed in this country was found to be positive. In the second case, there was no maculopapular rash and laboratory analysis showed an increase in leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and muscle enzymes. RT-PCR positivity was detected in the serum sample. The patient was followed up with supportive treatment and discharged with cure. DENV infections are caused by DENV which is common in the tropical areas of the world. There are four DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 serotypes. DENV infections can present different clinical manifestations such as asymptomatic disease, viral syndrome, Dengue haemorrhagic fever, and Dengue shock syndrome. Dengue fever is often accompanied by arthritis, maculopapular rash and high fever. Our cases were defined as Dengue fever according to this definition. In the diagnosis of the disease, it is necessary first to be suspicious of the disease and the travel history must be questioned. In the definitive diagnosis, virus isolation, antigen, nucleic acid detection and serological tests are used. The virus can be isolated from blood, serum, urine and tissues. In the first five days after beginning of the symptoms associated with DENV infections, serum RT-PCR and Dengue NS1 antigen test may be positive. <br>	2087	402	24
The major oligosaccharyl transferase complex genes are not involved in dengue virus replication in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.	Replication of the dengue virus (DENV) genome occurs in a vesicle in the endoplasmic reticulum by a complex of host and viral proteins. Two host proteins, STT3A and STT3B, as members of the oligosaccharyl transferase complex, have been implicated in playing structural roles in the vesicle in mammalian cells, and the absence of these proteins has been shown to decrease DENV replication. Aedes aegypti is the main vector of the virus and has been used previously as a model organism to study mosquito-virus interactions. In this study, we found that genes of the oligosaccharyl transferase complex have no effect on replication of DENV in mosquito cells. <br>	555	109	4
Dengue Virus M Protein Promotes NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation to Induce Vascular Leakage in Mice.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes serious clinical symptoms, including Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and Dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Vascular permeability change is the main feature of the diseases, and the abnormal expression of pro-inflammation cytokines is the important cause of vascular permeability change. However, the mechanism underlying vascular permeability induced by DENV is not fully elucidated. Here we reveal a distinct mechanism by which DENV infection promotes the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) release to induce endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in mice. DENV M protein interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate the NLRP3 inflammasome assemble and activation, which lead to the induction of pro-inflammation cytokine IL-1β activation and release. Notably, M can induce vascular leakage in mice tissues through activating NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β. More importantly, inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue injuries are induced by M in WT mice tissues, but they are not affected by M in NLRP3 knock-out (NLRP3-/-) mice tissues, and Evans blue intensities in WT mice tissues are significantly higher as compared with NLRP3-/- mice tissues, demonstrating an essential role of NLRP3 in M-induced vascular leakages in mice. Therefore, we propose that upon DENV infection, M interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate the inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion, which lead to induction of endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in mice tissues. The important role of the DENV-M-NLRP3-IL-1β axis in the induction of vascular leakage provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying DENV pathogenesis and DENV-associated DHF and DSS development.IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen and its infection is prevalent in over 100 tropical and sub-tropical countries or regions with approximately 2.5 billion people at risk. DENV infection induces a spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from classical dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying DENV pathogenesis. In this study, the authors reveal that the DENV membrane protein (M) interacts with the host NLRP3 protein to promote the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which leads to the activation and release of pro-inflammation cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). More importantly, the authors demonstrate that M protein can induce vascular permeability and vascular leakage and NLRP3 is required for M-induced vascular leakage in mice tissues. Collectively, this study reveals a distinct mechanism underlying DENV pathogeneses and provides new insights into the development of therapeutic agent for DENV-associated diseases. <br>	2389	419	14
Estimated dengue force of infection and burden of primary infections among Indian children.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspComprehensive, age-stratified dengue surveillance data are unavailable from India and many more dengue cases occur than are reported. Additional information on dengue transmission dynamics can inform understanding of disease endemicity and infection risk. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing age-stratified dengue IgG seroprevalence data from 2556 Indian children aged 5-10 years, we estimated annual force of infection (FOI) at each of 6 sites using a binomial regression model. We estimated the ages by which 50 and 70% of children were first infected; and predicted seroprevalence in children aged 1-10 years assuming constant force-of-infection. Applying these infection rates to national census data, we then calculated the number of primary dengue infections occurring, annually, in Indian children. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnnual force-of-infection at all sites combined was 11.9% (95% CI 8.8-16.2), varying across sites from 3.5% (95% CI 2.8-4.4) to 21.2% (95% CI 18.4-24.5). Overall, 50 and 70% of children were infected by 5.8 (95% CI 4.3-7.9) and 10.1 (95% CI 7.4-13.7) years respectively. In all sites except Kalyani, > 70% of children had been infected before their 11th birthday, and goodness-of-fit statistics indicated a relatively constant force-of-infection over time except at two sites (Wardha and Hyderabad). Nationwide, we estimated 17,013,527 children (95% CI: 14,518,438- 19,218,733), equivalent to 6.5% of children aged < 11 years, experience their first infection annually. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue force-of-infection in India is comparable to other highly endemic countries. Significant variation across sites exists, likely reflecting local epidemiological variation. The number of annual primary infections is indicative of a significant, under-reported burden of secondary infections and symptomatic episodes. <br><b>TRIAL REGISTRATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRegistered retrospectively with clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01477671 ; 18/11/2011) and clinical trials registry of India (ctri.nic.in; CTRI/2011/12/002243 ; 15/12/2011). Date of enrollment of 1st subject: 22/9/2011. <br>	1710	1137	13
Previous dengue or Zika virus exposure can drive to infection enhancement or neutralisation of other flaviviruses.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue virus (DENV) has circulated in Brazil for over 30 years. During this time, one serotype has cyclically replaced the other, until recently, when all four distinct serotypes began to circulate together. Persistent circulation of DENV for long time periods makes sequential infections throughout a person's life possible. After primary DENV infection, life-long immunity is developed for the infecting serotype. Since DENV and Zika virus (ZIKV) are antigenically similar, the possibility of cross-reactions has attracted attention and has been demonstrated in vitro. <br><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of this study was to investigate whether immune-sera from DENV and ZIKV infected patients would cross-react in vitro with other Flaviviridae family members. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCross-reaction of the studied samples with yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Rocio virus (ROCV), Saint Louis virus (SLEV) and Ilheus virus (ILHV) has been investigated by plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) and the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) by flow-cytometry. <br><b>FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAntibodies against ZIKV and DENV virus cross-reacted with other flaviviruses either neutralising or enhancing the infection. Thus, viral entrance into FcRFcɣRII-expressing cells were influenced by the cross-reactive antibodies. ZIKV or DENV immune sera enhanced cellular infection by WNV, ILHV, ROCV and SLEV. Finally, DENV immune sera presented higher neutralising activity for YFV and SLEV. While ZIKV immune sera neutralised WNV, ILHV and ROCV with high frequencies of positivity. <br><b>MAIN CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe co-circulation of those viruses in the same area represents a risk for the development of severe infections if they spread throughout the country. Successive flavivirus infections may have an impact on disease pathogenesis, as well as on the development of safe vaccine strategies. <br>	1545	978	14
Geographical distribution of primary & secondary dengue cases in India - 2017: A cross-sectional multicentric study.	<b>Background & objectives:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue virus infection is endemic in India with all the four serotypes of dengue virus in circulation. This study was aimed to determine the geographic distribution of the primary and secondary dengue cases in India. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted at Department of Health Research / Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR)/(ICMR) viral research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs) and selected ICMR institutes located in India. Only laboratory-confirmed dengue cases with date of onset of illness less than or equal to seven days were included between September and October 2017. Dengue NS1 antigen ELISA and anti-dengue IgM capture ELISA were used to diagnose dengue cases while anti-dengue IgG capture ELISA was used for identifying the secondary dengue cases. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOf the 1372 dengue cases, 897 (65%) were classified as primary dengue and 475 (35%) as secondary dengue cases. However, the proportion varied widely geographically, with Theni, Tamil Nadu; Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh and Udupi-Manipal, Karnataka reporting more than 65 per cent secondary dengue cases while Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir reporting as low as 10 per cent of the same. The median age of primary dengue cases was 25 yr [interquartile range (IQR 17-35] while that of secondary dengue cases was 23 yr (IQR 13.5-34). Secondary dengue was around 50 per cent among the children belonging to the age group 6-10 yr while it ranged between 20-43 per cent among other age groups. <br><b>Interpretation & conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur findings showed a wide geographical variation in the distribution of primary and secondary dengue cases in India. It would prove beneficial to include primary and secondary dengue differentiation protocol in the national dengue surveillance programme. <br>	1455	762	10
Geographical distribution, evaluation of risk of dengue and its relationship with the El Niño Southern Oscillation in an endemic region of Peru between 2004 and 2015.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo determine the geographical distribution and risk stratification of dengue infection in an endemic region of Peru, and its relationship with the presence of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the analysis, the definition and information about the ENSO events in Peru was obtained from the SENAMHI and IGP reports. The geographical distribution of dengue cases in the territory comprising the 11 districts is homogeneous. There were 1 498 confirmed cases of dengue reported, the highest incidence was determined in Puerto Inca where it reached an incidence of 3210.14/100,000 hab. Of the 11 districts, 2 were classified as a high risk of transmission, 3 as moderate risk, 3 as low risk and in 3 of them the risk of virus transmission could not be determined. <br>	643	183	5
A model to study the inhibition of nsP2B-nsP3 protease of dengue virus with imidazole, oxazole, triazole thiadiazole, and thiazolidine based scaffolds.	A theoretical model was developed to allosterically inhibit the biological activity of dengue virus (DENV) by targeting the non-structural protein ns2B-nsP3 protease based on the in silico studies. The imidazole, oxazole, triazole, thiadiazole, and thiazolidine based scaffolds were imported from the ZINC database, reported by various research group with different biological activity. They were found biologically active as they contain heterocyclic fragments. Generic evolutionary based molecular docking was performed to screen the highly potent molecule. The docking results show that the molecule having ZINC ID-633972 is best inhibitor. Further, the bioavailability and other physiochemical parameters were also calculated for the top four molecule. The highly potent molecule was further refined by the density functional theory and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. The MD analysis coroborate the successful docking of the molecule in the binding cavity of nsP2B-nsP3 protease of DENV. The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area approach was also applied and result coroborate the docking and MD result. <br>	974	164	9
Nature of Complex Network of Dengue Epidemic as a Scale-Free Network.	<b>Objectives:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue epidemic is a dynamic and complex phenomenon that has gained considerable attention due to its injurious effects. The focus of this study is to statically analyze the nature of the dengue epidemic network in terms of whether it follows the features of a scale-free network or a random network. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA multifarious network of Aedes aegypti is addressed keeping the viewpoint of a complex system and modelled as a network. The dengue network has been transformed into a one-mode network from a two-mode network by utilizing projection methods. Furthermore, three network features have been analyzed, the power-law, clustering coefficient, and network visualization. In addition, five methods have been applied to calculate the global clustering coefficient. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt has been observed that dengue epidemic follows a power-law, with the value of its exponent γ = -2.1. The value of the clustering coefficient is high for dengue cases, as weight of links. The minimum method showed the highest value among the methods used to calculate the coefficient. Network visualization showed the main areas. Moreover, the dengue situation did not remain the same throughout the observed period. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe results showed that the network topology exhibits the features of a scale-free network instead of a random network. Focal hubs are highlighted and the critical period is found. Outcomes are important for the researchers, health officials, and policy makers who deal with arbovirus epidemic diseases. Zika virus and Chikungunya virus can also be modelled and analyzed in this manner. <br>	1325	691	14
Diagnosis of severe dengue: Challenges, needs and opportunities.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDelayed diagnosis of dengue cases with increased risk for severe disease could lead to poor disease outcome. To date there is no specific laboratory diagnostic test for severe dengue. This qualitative study explored expert views regarding current issues in diagnosing severe dengue, rationale for severe dengue-specific diagnostics, future prospects and features of potential diagnostics for severe dengue. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn-depth individual interviews with thematic saturation were conducted between May and July 2018. The data was analyzed using thematic analysis. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBased on expert opinion, diagnosis of severe dengue is challenging as it depends on astute clinical interpretation of non-dengue-specific clinical and laboratory findings. A specific test that detects impending manifestation of severe dengue could 1) overcome failure in identifying severe disease for referral or admission, 2) facilitate timely and appropriate management of plasma leakage and bleeding, 3) overcome the lack of clinical expertise and laboratory diagnosis in rural health settings. The most important feature of any diagnostics for severe dengue is the point-of-care (POC) format where it can be performed at or near the bedside. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe development of diagnostics to detect impending severe dengue is warranted to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates of dengue infection and it should be prioritized. <br>	1177	603	8
Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Substituted 4,6-Dihydrospiro[[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-b]pyridine-7,3'-indoline]-2',5(3H)-dione Analogues as Potent NS4B Inhibitors for the Treatment of Dengue Virus Infection.	A series of substituted 4,6-dihydrospiro[[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-b]pyridine-7,3'-indoline]-2',5(3H)-dione analogues were synthesized and evaluated as potent dengue virus inhibitors. Throughout a structure-activity relationship exploration on the amide of the indolone moiety, a wide range of substitutions were found to be well tolerated for chemical optimization at this position. Among these compounds, 15 (JMX0254) displayed the most potent and broad inhibitory activities, effective against DENV-1 to -3 with EC50 values of 0.78, 0.16, and 0.035 μM, respectively, while compounds 16, 21, 27-29, 47, and 70 exhibited relatively moderate to high activities with low micromolar to nanomolar potency against all four serotypes. The biotinylated compound 73 enriched NS4B protein from cell lysates in pull-down studies, and the findings together with the mutation investigations further validated dengue NS4B protein as the target of this class of compounds. More importantly, compound 15 exhibited good in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and efficacy in the A129 mouse model, indicating its therapeutic potential against the dengue virus infection as a drug candidate for further preclinical development. <br>	1042	190	5
Clinical relevance of Zika symptoms in the context of a Zika Dengue epidemic.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe clinical characteristics of the most frequent arbovirosis (Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya) are very similar, which is a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. <br><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo identify the presence of clinical characteristics related to Zika virus infection confirmed by the laboratory in patients during an epidemic of co-infection with Zika and Dengue viruses. <br><b>METHOD:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCross-sectional descriptive study of patients with clinical - epidemiological suspicion of Zika virus infection, who were admitted in the Hospital "Joaquín Albarrán" (La Habana, Cuba), during June 1 to October 31 of 2017. Demographic and symptoms and signs were recorded. By PCR for Zika virus (in blood or urine) the disease was confirmed. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1541 patients were studied. The most frequent symptoms and signs were rash (93.8%), pruritus (77.9%), arthralgia (60.0%), headache (50.8%), myalgia (46.1%), fever (34.7%), asthenia (31.7%), and conjunctivitis (27.9%). Zika virus infection was confirmed in 279 patients (18.1%). Greater frequency of arthralgia, asthenia, and diarrhea was demonstrated in Zika confirmed patients. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMinor clinical relevance was observed in the symptoms or signs of arboviral disease to support the clinical diagnosis of Zika virus infections by clinician during a Zika-Dengue epidemic. The assessment of the temporality of the onset of Zika and Dengue symptoms of these infections is recommended to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis. <br>	1215	677	10
Structural and Functional Properties of the Capsid Protein of Dengue and Related Flavivirus.	Dengue, West Nile and Zika, closely related viruses of the Flaviviridae family, are an increasing global threat, due to the expansion of their mosquito vectors. They present a very similar viral particle with an outer lipid bilayer containing two viral proteins and, within it, the nucleocapsid core. This core is composed by the viral RNA complexed with multiple copies of the capsid protein, a crucial structural protein that mediates not only viral assembly, but also encapsidation, by interacting with host lipid systems. The capsid is a homodimeric protein that contains a disordered N-terminal region, an intermediate flexible fold section and a very stable conserved fold region. Since a better understanding of its structure can give light into its biological activity, here, first, we compared and analyzed relevant mosquito-borne Flavivirus capsid protein sequences and their predicted structures. Then, we studied the alternative conformations enabled by the N-terminal region. Finally, using dengue virus capsid protein as main model, we correlated the protein size, thermal stability and function with its structure/dynamics features. The findings suggest that the capsid protein interaction with host lipid systems leads to minor allosteric changes that may modulate the specific binding of the protein to the viral RNA. Such mechanism can be targeted in future drug development strategies, namely by using improved versions of pep14-23, a dengue virus capsid protein peptide inhibitor, previously developed by us. Such knowledge can yield promising advances against Zika, dengue and closely related Flavivirus. <br>	1391	247	10
Simultaneous zika and dengue serotype-4 viral detection and isolation from a donor plasma unit.	During zika and dengue viruse (ZIKV and DENV) outbreaks, the majority of the infected individuals remain clinically asymptomatic. Such asymptomatic individuals may occasionally acquire both arboviruses, donate blood, and contaminate haemoderivatives. The aim of this study was to characterize a ZIKV/DENV-4 coinfection in asymptomatic blood donor who donated blood during a large mixed ZIKV/DENV outbreak in the Säo Paulo State, Brazil. On the basis of post-donation information, one blood donor sample was found positive for ZIKV and DENV RNA. The DENV molecular serotyping was performed by molecular testing. The sample was also titrated on VERO E6 cells in order to define the presence of infectious arboviruses. The real-time PCR testing of the blood donor sample demonstrated very high viral load for both ZIKV and DENV. Further, molecular serotyping of DENV showed that the presence of DENV-4. The viral titration in cell culture indicated a titre of 2.75x10[6] PFU/ml which was concordant with the presence of infectious viruses in the blood donation. This is an interesting report for the simultaneous presence of infectious ZIKV and DENV-4 in asymptomatic blood sample. Special attention must be paid during mixed arboviral outbreaks for the possibility of transfusion-transmission of multiple arboviral agents. <br>	1129	210	11
HLA Upregulation During Dengue Virus Infection Suppresses the Natural Killer Cell Response.	Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus in the world and a major cause of morbidity in the tropics and subtropics. Upregulation of HLA class I molecules has long been considered a feature of DENV infection, yet this has not been evaluated in the setting of natural infection. Natural killer (NK) cells, an innate immune cell subset critical for mounting an early response to viral infection, are inhibited by self HLA class I, suggesting that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection could dampen the NK cell response. Here we addressed whether upregulation of HLA class I molecules occurs during in vivo DENV infection and, if so, whether this suppresses the NK cell response. We found that HLA class I expression was indeed upregulated during acute DENV infection across multiple cell lineages in vivo. To better understand the role of HLA class I upregulation, we infected primary human monocytes, a major target of DENV infection, in vitro. Upregulation of total HLA class I is dependent on active viral replication and is mediated in part by cytokines and other soluble factors induced by infection, while upregulation of HLA-E occurs in the presence of replication-incompetent virus. Importantly, blocking DENV-infected monocytes with a pan-HLA class I Fab nearly doubles the frequency of degranulating NK cells, while blocking HLA-E does not significantly improve the NK cell response. These findings demonstrate that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection suppresses the NK cell response, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis. <br>	1347	256	9

Forecasting dengue fever in Brazil: An assessment of climate conditions.	Local climate conditions play a major role in the biology of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the main vector responsible for transmitting dengue, zika, chikungunya and yellow fever in urban centers. For this reason, a detailed assessment of periods in which changes in climate conditions affect the number of human cases may improve the timing of vector-control efforts. In this work, we develop new machine-learning algorithms to analyze climate time series and their connection to the occurrence of dengue epidemic years for seven Brazilian state capitals. Our method explores the impact of two key variables-frequency of precipitation and average temperature-during a wide range of time windows in the annual cycle. Our results indicate that each Brazilian state capital considered has its own climate signatures that correlate with the overall number of human dengue-cases. However, for most of the studied cities, the winter preceding an epidemic year shows a strong predictive power. Understanding such climate contributions to the vector's biology could lead to more accurate prediction models and early warning systems. <br>	960	177	7
Evaluating the effects of control interventions and estimating the inapparent infections for dengue outbreak in Hangzhou, China.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe number of dengue fever (DF) cases and the number of dengue outbreaks have increased in recent years in Zhejiang Province, China. An unexpected dengue outbreak was reported in Hangzhou in 2017 and caused more than one thousand dengue cases. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of the actual control measures, estimate the proportion of inapparent infections during this outbreak and simulate epidemic development based on different levels of control measures taking inapparent infections into consideration. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe epidemic data of dengue cases in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, in 2017 and the number of the people exposed to the outbreaks were obtained from the China Information Network System of Disease Prevention and Control. The epidemic without intervention measures was used to estimate the unknown parameters. A susceptible-exposed-infectious/inapparent-recovered (SEIAR) model was used to estimate the effectiveness of the control interventions. The inapparent infections were also evaluated at the same time. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn total, 1137 indigenous dengue cases were reported in Hangzhou in 2017. The number of indigenous dengue cases was estimated by the SEIAR model. This number was predicted to reach 6090 by the end of November 2, 2017, if no control measures were implemented. The total number of reported cases was reduced by 81.33% in contrast to the estimated incidence without intervention. The number of average daily inapparent cases was 10.18 times higher than the number of symptomatic cases. The earlier and more rigorously the vector control interventions were implemented, the more effective they were. The results showed that implementing vector control continuously for more than twenty days was more effective than every few days of implementation. Case isolation is not sufficient enough for epidemic control and only reduced the incidence by 38.10% in contrast to the estimated incidence without intervention, even if case isolation began seven days after the onset of the first case. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe practical control interventions in the outbreaks that occurred in Hangzhou City were highly effective. The proportion of inapparent infections was large, and it played an important role in transmitting the disease during this epidemic. Early, continuous and high efficacy vector control interventions are necessary to limit the development of a dengue epidemic. Timely diagnosis and case reporting are important in the intervention at an early stage of the epidemic. <br>	2123	1007	18
Use of a Blockade-of-Binding ELISA and Microneutralization Assay to Evaluate Zika Virus Serostatus in Dengue-Endemic Areas.	Zika virus (ZIKV) serological diagnostics are compromised in areas where dengue viruses (DENV) co-circulate because of their high levels of protein sequence homology. Here, we describe the characterization of a Zika blockade-of-binding ELISA (Zika BOB) and a Zika microneutralization assay (Zika MN) for the detection of ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-specific antibodies and ZIKV neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Zika BOB and Zika MN cutoffs were established as 10 and 100 endpoint titers, respectively, using samples collected pre- and post-virologically confirmed ZIKV infection from subjects living in DENV-endemic areas. Specificity of the assays was equally high, whereas sensitivity of Zika BOB was lower than that of Zika MN, especially in samples collected > 6 months post-infection. Immunosurveillance analysis, using combined results from both Zika BOB and Zika MN, carried out also in DENV-endemic regions in Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, and Puerto Rico before (2013-2014) and after (2017-2018) ZIKV introduction in the Americas suggests unapparent ZIKV seroprevalence rates ranged from 25% to 80% over the specified period of time in the regions investigated. <br>	1018	180	5
Epidemiological and Evolutionary Analysis of Dengue-1 Virus Detected in Guangdong during 2014: Recycling of Old and Formation of New Lineages.	The incidence of dengue is increasing in Guangdong, China, with the largest outbreak to date in 2014. Widespread awareness of epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the dengue virus (DENV) is required. In 2014, we isolated the virus from patients and sequenced its genome. The sequences of DENV isolated from Guangdong and other countries screened since 2005 were studied to establish molecular evolutionary databases along with epidemiological data to explore its epidemiological, phylogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Causes underlying the occurrence of the dengue epidemic included importation and localization of the virus. The number of indigenous cases significantly exceeded that of imported cases. Dengue virus 1 is the most important serotype and caused the long-term epidemic locally. Based on the data available since 2005, DENV1 was divided into three genotypes (I, IV, and V). Only genotypes I and V were detected in 2014. In 2014, an epidemic involving old lineages of DENV1 genotype V occurred after 2 years of silence. The genotype was previously detected from 2009 to 2011. Genotype I, which caused recent epidemics, demonstrated a continuation of new lineages, and a predictive pattern of molecular evolution since 2005 among the four lineages was present. The DENV isolated from Guangdong was closely related to those causing large-scale epidemics in neighboring countries, suggesting the possibility of its import from these countries. The lack of sufficient epidemiological data and evidence on the local mosquito-borne DENV emphasizes the importance of studying the molecular evolutionary features and establishing a well-established phylogenetic tree for dengue prevention and control in Guangdong. <br>	1490	260	11
Dengue Myocarditis: An Important Clinical Entity to Consider in Dengue Patient.	We are going to report a case study of dengue fever (DF) affecting myocardium and explore the literature. A gentleman of 28 years old experienced DF which was complicated by acute myocarditis, acute kidney injury and hepatitis in the Emergency Department of Apollo Hospitals, Dhaka, Bangladesh on 5th August 2017. Clinically it was considered as an acute coronary syndrome due to depressed ST segment in chest leads ECG, extreme bradycardia but normal serum troponin-I level. He had to undergo temporary pacemaker insertion for symptomatic bradycardia and later on, he was monitored closely. Fortunately, he recovered; pacemaker was removed on day 8 of his admission without any further complication. After 3 days, patient recovered with symptomatic treatment. In different publications, various manifestations of cardiac complications occurred, from self-limiting tachy-brady arrhythmia to severe damage of the myocardium, causing reduced blood pressure and pulmonary edema. To reduce morbidity and mortality, physicians should suspect for cardiac complications in patients with dengue fever and should manage these complications. <br>	974	168	7
Dengue Virus NS1 Exposure Affects von Willebrand Factor Profile and Platelet Adhesion Properties of Cultured Vascular Endothelial Cells.	Hematological abnormalities and altered vascular permeability are frequently encountered in Dengue virus infected patients, but the mechanisms that alter platelet-endothelium interactions remain incompletely understood. The DENV NS1 protein has been implicated in adverse disease outcomes. In the present study the role of NS1 protein in affecting the expression of vWF and platelet adhesion properties of endothelial cells was studied in vitro. The results suggest that vWF is down regulated in cultured endothelial cells 6 and 24 h after exposure with increase in vWF levels in culture supernatants at corresponding time points. Ultrastructural studies showed distinct evidence of endothelial cell activation morphology and degranulation of Weibel-Palade bodies in NS1 exposed cells that also showed increased platelet activation physiology. The findings suggest that changes in vWF production and secretion may be induced in endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS1 protein; and play a role in bleeding complications of severe DENV disease. <br>	897	153	6
Multiplexed Adaptive RT-PCR Based on L-DNA Hybridization Monitoring for the Detection of Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya RNA.	Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for the molecular diagnosis of many infectious diseases, including RNA viruses, but is generally limited to settings with access to trained personnel and laboratory resources. We have previously reported a fundamentally simpler thermal cycling platform called Adaptive PCR, which dynamically controls thermal cycling conditions during each cycle by optically monitoring the annealing and melting of mirror-image L-DNA surrogates of the PCR primers and targets. In this report, we integrate optically-controlled reverse transcription and single-channel monitoring of L-DNAs to develop a multiplexed Adaptive RT-PCR instrument and assay for the detection of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus RNA with high target specific and low limits of detection. The assay is demonstrated to detect as low as 5 copies/reaction of Zika or chikungunya RNA and 50 copies/reaction of dengue RNA. The multiplexed Adaptive RT-PCR instrument is robust and has many of the features required to implement diagnostic assays for RNA viruses in settings that lack traditional laboratory resources. <br>	992	177	5
Serine protease inhibitor AEBSF reduces dengue virus infection via decreased cholesterol synthesis.	Dengue virus (DENV) infection has evolved into a major global health menace and economic burden due to its intensity and geographic distribution. DENV infection in humans can cause a wide range of symptoms including dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). An antiviral agent that is effective against all four serotypes of DENV is urgently needed to prevent and to manage this condition. Reducing the viral load during the early phase of infection may minimize the chance of patients progressing to more severe DHF or DSS. In this study, we set forth to investigate the anti-viral effect of five commercially available protease inhibitors on DENV infection since both viral and host proteases can contribute to effective viral replication. Previously, the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene sulfonyl fluoride] has been shown to inhibit DENV NS3 protease activity. The results of the present study revealed that DENV genome replication and protein synthesis were significantly inhibited by AEBSF in a dose-dependent manner. AEBSF inhibited the expression of genes such as 3-hydroxy 3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Moreover, AEBSF significantly inhibited HMGCR activity and intracellular cholesterol synthesis after DENV infection. The anti-DENV effect of AEBSF was confirmed in all four DENV serotypes and in three different cell lines. These results indicate that AEBSF reduces DENV infection via both viral and host protease activities. <br>	1382	248	11
Dengue genetic divergence generates within-serotype antigenic variation, but serotypes dominate evolutionary dynamics.	Dengue virus (DENV) exists as four genetically distinct serotypes, each of which is historically assumed to be antigenically uniform. Recent analyses suggest that antigenic heterogeneity may exist within each serotype, but its source, extent and impact remain unclear. Here, we construct a sequence-based model to directly map antigenic change to underlying genetic divergence. We identify 49 specific substitutions and four colinear substitution clusters that robustly predict dengue antigenic relationships. We report moderate antigenic diversity within each serotype, resulting in genotype-specific patterns of heterotypic cross-neutralization. We also quantify the impact of antigenic variation on real-world DENV population dynamics, and find that serotype-level antigenic fitness is a dominant driver of dengue clade turnover. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between dengue genetic and antigenic evolution, and quantify the effect of antigenic fitness on dengue evolutionary dynamics. <br>	897	145	7
Integrated vector management with additional pre-transmission season thermal fogging is associated with a reduction in dengue incidence in Makassar, Indonesia: Results of an 8-year observational study.	Dengue virus transmission is endemic in Makassar, Indonesia, with the majority of cases reported soon after the start of the annual rainy season. Before 2006, larval source reduction, larvaciding, and reactive routine, outdoor, insecticide fogging campaigns did not result in a reduction in seasonal dengue incidence. Beginning in 2006, village volunteers conducted comprehensive surveys for immature Aedes during the dry season, when vector populations were at their lowest. Based on this pre-season vector data, a single additional pre-emptive outdoor fogging with Malathion was conducted once annually before the rains began in villages with a pre-defined proportion of sampled houses positive for Aedes immatures. This additional procedure was associated with reduced temporal larval indices as well as an 83% reduction in reported cases during the transmission season over the 8-year period of implementation. Two cities adjacent to Makassar experienced substantial but smaller reductions in dengue incidence; while other cities further from the intervention area did not. This represents the first time an integrated intervention strategy has been coupled with substantially reduced dengue transmission in Indonesia. <br>	1054	180	7

Dengue infection and advances in dengue vaccines for children.	Dengue viruses are endemic in most tropical and subtropical countries where they produce disease ranging from a mild fever to a severe, potentially fatal vascular permeability syndrome. We reviewed the status of development and testing in children of three vaccines designed to protect against the four dengue viruses. The first dengue virus vaccine, Dengvaxia, now licensed in 20 endemic countries, the EU and the USA, provides protection against severe dengue in seropositive individuals but increases the risk for naive recipients to develop severe dengue and to be hospitalised. We discuss mechanisms and implications of shortcomings of the licensed vaccine and describe the structure and attributes of two other dengue virus vaccines. Based upon human dengue challenge studies, one of these vaccines promises to deliver solid, long-lasting immunity after a single dose. Because dengue virus infections are ubiquitous in residents and visitors to tropical countries, in the absence of a protective vaccine paediatricians should recognise the early signs and clinical presentation of severe dengue, understand its pathophysiology and appropriate management. <br>	997	172	6
Pre-vaccination screening strategies for the use of the CYD-TDV dengue vaccine: A meeting report.	The first licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia) is efficacious in seropositive individuals, but increases the risk for severe dengue in seronegative persons about two years after administration of the first dose. For countries considering the introduction of Dengvaxia, WHO recommends a pre-vaccination screening strategy whereby only persons with evidence of a past dengue infection would be vaccinated. Policy-makers need to consider the risk-benefit of vaccination strategies based on such screening tests, the optimal age to introduce the vaccine, communication and implementation strategies. To address these questions, the Global Dengue and Aedes-transmitted diseases Consortium (GDAC) organized a 3-day workshop in January 2019 with country representatives from Asia and Latin America. The meeting discussions highlighted many challenges in introducing Dengvaxia, in terms of screening test characteristics, costs of such tests combined with a 3-dose schedule, logistics, achieving high coverage rates, vaccine confidence and communication; more challenges than for any other vaccine introduction programme. A screening test would require a high specificity to minimize individual risk, and at the same time high sensitivity to maximize individual and population benefit. The underlying seroprevalence dependent positive predictive value is the best indicator for an acceptable safety profile of a pre-vaccination screening strategy. The working groups discussed many possible implementation strategies. Addressing the bottlenecks in school-based vaccine introduction for Dengvaxia will also benefit other vaccines such as HPV and booster doses for tetanus and pertussis. Levels of public trust are highly variable and context specific, and understanding of population perceptions and concerns is essential to tailor interventions, monitor and mitigate risks. <br>	1624	266	10
Spatio-temporal distribution analysis of circulating genotypes of dengue virus type 1 in western and southern states of India by a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay.	Dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) Asian and American/African (AM/AF) genotypes were reported to be co-circulating in southern and western states of India based on envelope (E) gene sequencing of few representative samples. The objective of the present study was to develop a one-step real-time RT-PCR to discriminate between Asian and AM/AF genotypes of DENV-1 and investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of the DENV-1 genotypes in southern and western states of India. A one-step real-time RT-PCR to discriminate the Asian and AM/AF genotypes of DENV-1 was developed and validated using 40 samples (17 Asian and 23 AM/AF), for which the envelope (E) gene sequence data was available. DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 isolates, one each and DENV negative samples (n = 17) were also tested by the assay. Additional 296 samples positive for DENV-1 from selected Southern and Western states of India were genotyped using the real-time RT-PCR assay. Among the samples used for validation, the genotyping results were concordant with sequencing results for 39 samples. In the one discordant sample which was positive for AM/AF by sequencing, the genotyping assay tested positive for both Asian and AM/AF genotype. DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 isolates were not reactive in the assay. None of the DENV negative samples were positive (sensitivity 100% and specificity 98.2%). A total of 336 samples (40 samples with sequence data and 296 samples without sequence data) were used for spatio-temporal distribution analysis. The results revealed that the Asian genotype was the predominant genotype in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the southern states. The AM/AF genotype was the predominant genotype in Maharashtra, a western state of India. In Nashik district of Maharashtra, Asian genotype was observed in 32.6% of DENV-1 samples during 2017 while the same decreased to 7.3% during 2018. In Pune district, Asian genotype was observed in 40.0% of DENV-1 samples during 2018 only. To conclude, a one step real-time RT-PCR has been developed for discriminating Asian and AM/AF genotypes of DENV-1. This assay can act as a complement to sequencing but not a substitute and can be utilized in resource limited settings for molecular surveillance of DENV-1. DENV-1 Asian genotype was the dominant genotype in South India while, AM/AF genotype was dominant in Western India. <br>	1983	410	16

Dengue Cases in Colombia: Mathematical Forecasts for 2018-2022.	INTRODUCTION Dengue is a disease caused by any one of five virus serotypes and transmitted to humans by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Climate change and health conditions have combined to make dengue a global public health problem. The situation is especially serious in Colombia, where by week 36 of 2018, dengue incidence was 96 cases per 100,000 population, with a total of 111 deaths. Different mathematical and statistical models have been proposed to understand the dynamics of transmission and consequently to apply control strategies to reduce the number of dengue cases. OBJECTIVE Forecast the number of dengue cases expected in Colombia from 2018 through 2022 with the stochastic Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and use the results to adjust the parameters of an ordinary differential equations model in order to determine the disease's basic reproduction number in the year presenting the highest number of dengue cases. METHODS An ecological time series study was conducted to forecast dengue incidence in Colombia from 2018 through 2022. The data were compiled from Colombia's National Health Institute series on dengue cases reported by epidemiological week from 2009 to 2017. The stochastic ARIMA time series model was applied. Forecasts were then analyzed, and the year with the highest number of predicted cases was used to adjust the parameters of an ordinary differential equations model (ODE) through nonlinear least squares regression to calculate the vectorial capacity of the transmitting mosquito. RESULTS Forecasts of the total number of dengue cases per year in Colombia for the following five years were: 32,411 (2018); 88,221 (2019); 56,392 (2020); 47,940 (2021); and 77,344 (2022). The highest number of cases was forecast for 2019. Values for the parameters affecting dengue transmission that year (by the year's four quarters), such as recovery rate (0.0992, 0.0838, 0.1177, and 0.1535, respectively), vectorial capacity of the transmitting mosquito (0.1720, 0.1705, 0.1204, and 0.2147, respectively) and the basic dengue reproduction number (1.73, 2.03, 1.02, and 1.40, respectively) were estimated, indicating that most cases would occur in the second quarter and, since the basic reproduction number values were >1, the disease would persist in the country throughout the entire year. CONCLUSIONS ARIMA model forecasts for 2018 through 2022 predicted the highest incidence of dengue cases in Colombia would occur in 2019. Comparison of ARIMA model forecasts and the ODE model allowed projections of possible variations in dengue cases reported, and the basic reproduction number predicted that dengue would persist throughout 2019.

Diagnostic accuracy and predictive value in differentiating the severity of dengue infection.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo review the diagnostic test accuracy and predictive value of statistical models in differentiating the severity of dengue infection. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspElectronic searches were conducted in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (complete), PubMed and Scopus. Eligible studies to be included in this review were cohort studies with participants confirmed by laboratory test for dengue infection and comparison among the different severity of dengue infection by using statistical models. The methodological quality of the paper was assessed by independent reviewers using QUADAS-2. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwenty-six studies published from 1994 to 2017 were included. Most diagnostic models produced an accuracy of 75% to 80% except one with 86%. Two models predicting severe dengue according to the WHO 2009 classification have 86% accuracy. Both of these logistic regression models were applied during the first three days of illness, and their sensitivity and specificity were 91-100% and 79.3-86%, respectively. Another model which evaluated the 30-day mortality of dengue infection had an accuracy of 98.5%. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough there are several potential predictive or diagnostic models for dengue infection, their limitations could affect their validity. It is recommended that these models be revalidated in other clinical settings and their methods be improved and standardised in future. <br>	1209	572	11
Novel differential linear B-cell epitopes to identify Zika and dengue virus infections in patients.	<b>Objectives:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRecent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks challenged existing laboratory diagnostic standards, especially for serology-based methods. Because of the genetic and structural similarity of ZIKV with other flaviviruses, this results in cross-reactive antibodies, which confounds serological interpretations. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPlasma from Singapore ZIKV patients was screened longitudinally for antibody responses and neutralising capacities against ZIKV. Samples from healthy controls, ZIKV patients and DENV patients were further assessed using ZIKV and DENV peptides of precursor membrane (prM), envelope (E) or non-structural 1 (NS1) viral proteins in a peptide-based ELISA for epitope identification. Identified epitopes were re-validated and diagnostically evaluated using sera of patients with DENV, bacteria or unknown infections from Thailand. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLong-lasting ZIKV-neutralising antibodies were elicited during ZIKV infection. Thirteen potential linear B-cell epitopes were identified, and of these, four common flavivirus, three ZIKV-specific and one DENV-specific differential epitopes had more than 50% sensitivity and specificity. Notably, ZIKV-specific peptide 26 on domain I/II of E protein (amino acid residues 271-288) presented 80% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. Importantly, the differential epitopes also showed significance in differentiating non-flavivirus patient samples. <br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLinear B-cell epitope candidates to differentiate between ZIKV and DENV infections were identified, providing the first step towards the design of a much-needed serology-based assay. <br>	1355	636	10
Risk prediction for severe disease and better diagnostic accuracy in early dengue infection; the Colombo dengue study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA major challenge in dengue management in resource limited settings is the confirmation of diagnosis. Clinical features of dengue often overlap with other infections and molecular diagnostic tools are not readily accessible to clinicians at hospitals. In addition, the prediction of plasma leakage in dengue is also difficult. Hematocrit level and ultrasound scans (combined with clinical parameters) are helpful to detect plasma leakage once it has happened, not before. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspColombo Dengue Study (CDS) is a prospective cohort study of clinically suspected adult dengue patients recruited from the National hospital of Sri Lanka (within the first 3 days of fever) that aimed to a) identify clinical and basic laboratory test parameters to differentiate dengue from non-dengue fever, b) evaluate the comparative efficacy of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for dengue diagnosis (vs. NS1 antigen test and RT-qPCR) and c) identify early associations that are predictive of plasma leakage or severe dengue. The basic laboratory tests considered here included hematological parameters, serum biochemistry and inflammatory markers. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnly 70% of clinically suspected patients were confirmed as having dengue by either the NS1 antigen test or RT-qPCR. On a Bayesian latent class model which assumes no "gold standard", LAMP performed equally or better than RT-qPCR and NS1 antigen test respectively. When confirmed dengue patients were compared with others, the earlier group had significantly lower lymphocyte counts and higher aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST) within the first 3 days of fever. Confirmed dengue patients with plasma leakage had a lower mean age and a higher median baseline AST level compared to those without plasma leakage (p < 0.05). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClinical suspicion overestimates the true number of dengue patients. RT-LAMP is a potentially useful low-cost diagnostic tool for dengue diagnosis. Confirmed dengue patients had significantly higher AST levels and lower lymphocyte counts in early disease compared to others. In confirmed dengue patients, younger age and a higher AST level in early infection were associated with subsequent plasma leakage. <br>	1854	911	15
Primary infection with dengue or Zika virus does not affect the severity of heterologous secondary infection in macaques.	Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are genetically and antigenically related flaviviruses that now co-circulate in much of the tropical and subtropical world. The rapid emergence of ZIKV in the Americas in 2015 and 2016, and its recent associations with Guillain-Barré syndrome, birth defects, and fetal loss have led to the hypothesis that DENV infection induces cross-reactive antibodies that influence the severity of secondary ZIKV infections. It has also been proposed that pre-existing ZIKV immunity could affect DENV pathogenesis. We examined outcomes of secondary ZIKV infections in three rhesus and fifteen cynomolgus macaques, as well as secondary DENV-2 infections in three additional rhesus macaques up to a year post-primary ZIKV infection. Although cross-binding antibodies were detected prior to secondary infection for all animals and cross-neutralizing antibodies were detected for some animals, previous DENV or ZIKV infection had no apparent effect on the clinical course of heterotypic secondary infections in these animals. All animals had asymptomatic infections and, when compared to controls, did not have significantly perturbed hematological parameters. Rhesus macaques infected with DENV-2 approximately one year after primary ZIKV infection had higher vRNA loads in plasma when compared with serum vRNA loads from ZIKV-naive animals infected with DENV-2, but a differential effect of sample type could not be ruled out. In cynomolgus macaques, the serotype of primary DENV infection did not affect the outcome of secondary ZIKV infection. <br>	1350	242	8
Dengue fever in Southern of Vietnam: A survey of reported knowledge, attitudes, and practices.	<b>Objective:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever (DF) is an acute infectious disease with high incidence in tropical countries, such as Vietnam, where dengue prevention is a challenge for the health sector, government, and policy makers. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices in southern Vietnam and explore their relationships with the characteristics of the people. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cross-sectional study was conducted, using interviews with 1,906 urban participants and 493 rural participants in southern Vietnam in July 2018. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe study found a lack of knowledge regarding DF symptoms, with only 37.2% having a good level of knowledge, although 57.1% had good attitudes and 56.1% had good practices. Television (85.4 %) and the internet (69.5%) were the two main sources of information, and information provided by healthcare professionals was low. Participants with good knowledge had approximately 1.7 times the probability of having a good attitude and 5.0 times the probability of having good practices of those without. Urban participants had 1.3 times the level of knowledge than those in rural areas (p = 0.025), while the quality of attitude scores of rural participants was 1.3 times (p = 0.029) that of urban participants. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspImprovements in knowledge of DF, as well as in attitudes and practices toward dengue, are required, such as might be achieved through increased publicity and knowledge dissemination. <br>	1191	652	7
Revisiting dengue-related knowledge, attitudes and practices: A cross-sectional study in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 2018.	<b>Objective:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn recent years, Vietnam has been recorded as one of the most endemic areas of dengue fever (DF). Thus, controlling DF has become a matter of concern to healthcare professionals and the government. Nevertheless, there has been little research exploring inhabitants' awareness about DF in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The aims of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding DF by the population in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn July 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,175 people in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, using an administered questionnaire. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnly 38% of participants had good knowledge, and 55% of the population reached the satisfactory practices score, while 74% showed positive attitudes relating to DF. Unlike many other studies, education level was not associated with KAP score. However, marital status and monthly income seemed to be related to participants' knowledge levels. In addition, the main sources of information in this research were television and the Internet. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study showed that participants lacked knowledge regarding DF and practices to prevent it. These results recommend improving the population's knowledge andpractices through campaigns aimed at preventing breeding of mosquitoes. <br>	1077	616	11
Knowledge, attitudes, and practices among university students in relation to dengue fever: A multi-center study across Vietnamese regions.	<b>Objective:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDengue fever (DF) is a serious illness worldwide that can spread rapidly and become a dangerous epidemic. Vietnam is an endemic country affected by the health and economic burden of dengue. This study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to DF among university students across Vietnam. <br><b>Methods:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA student-based cross-sectional study was performed with a structured questionnaire in Vietnam between July and September 2018. A Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare different issues between two student groups, including medical and non-medical student, and P-values of <0.05 were considered significant. <br><b>Results:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 1,542 students from universities in Vietnam responded to the survey, which was reflective of 315 medical students learning in public schools, 689 medical students learning in private schools, and 538 non-medical students. The majority of participants had good knowledge on the transmission of DF, good attitudes toward DF, and good practices to prevent the disease. Medical students had better knowledge of the signs and symptoms than non-medical students. However, both student groups' knowledge of signs and symptoms was low. <br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspQuality of education is a key determinant of the knowledge of the disease, as well as of attitudes and practices. This study supported the government's implementation of intervention projects and DF prevention campaigns and its positive participation in the community. <br>	1245	654	10
Seroprevalence of Dengue Virus Among Pregnant Women in Guangdong, China.	Guangdong is a main dengue epidemic area in China and undergoes dengue outbreaks frequently. In 2014, Guangdong experienced a serious dengue outbreak with 45,224 confirmed cases and six deaths, which might affect the seroprevalence among the local population. There is evidence that dengue virus (DENV) infection during pregnancy may cause adverse outcomes. Therefore, it is important to assess the seroprevalence of DENV among Guangdong pregnant women. We aimed to survey the seroprevalence of anti-DENV antibodies among pregnant women in Guangdong and to analyze the features of different seroprofiles. We collected a total 951 samples from pregnant women living in Guangdong in 2016. All serum samples were screened for DENV-specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed using capture ELISA. In IgM-positive samples, we performed DENV RNA detection using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We collected information of delivery outcomes, neonate features, and clinical laboratory variables of parturients and newborns following delivery. Seroprevalence of DENV among the women in our sample was 4.31%. A total 1.26% and 3.15% of samples were IgM and IgG positive, respectively. In addition, 22.22% of IgM-positive and 9.09% of IgG-positive participants had adverse outcomes. There was no difference with respect to adverse outcomes compared with controls (8.80%) who were IgG and IgM negative. There was no difference in clinical laboratory variables among the different seroprofiles. We found a high seroprevalence of DENV among pregnant women in Guangdong comparing with the overall seroprevalence of local population before 2014. Asymptomatic DENV infection during pregnancy was not found to contribute to adverse outcomes. <br>	1545	274	14
Significance of RANTES-CCR5 axis and linked downstream immunomodulation in Dengue pathogenesis: A study from Guwahati, India.	We aimed to evaluate the significance of the RANTES-CCR5 axis and resulting immunomodulatory status in Dengue pathogenesis involving a Guwahati, India based population where Dengue cases have increased alarmingly. An increased CC-chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) messenger RNA expression and CCR5 positive cell count profile was observed in Dengue cases, the highest being in severe cases. CCR5 ligand RANTES expression was significantly decreased in Dengue cases and inversely correlated with Dengue viremia fold change in severe cases. Monocytes are involved in Dengue virus homing and replication. Its levels and activation profile were higher in Dengue cases. A hyper Th1-biased immunomodulatory profile with upregulated tumor necrosis factor-α levels, and downregulated expression of antiviral cytokine interferon-γ and key regulatory Th2 anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 was observed in severe Dengue cases compared with mild Dengue cases and controls. The results, therefore, suggest the significance of RANTES-CCR5 axis deregulation and resulting altered immunomodulation in Dengue pathogenesis, and holds prognostic and therapeutic significance. <br>	1011	167	7
Dengue and Zika Virus Domain III-Flagellin Fusion and Glycan-Masking E Antigen for Prime-Boost Immunization.	The viral E proteins of dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are the major viral proteins involved in receptor binding and fusion, and for the induction of protective antibodies against viral infections. DIII of the E proteins is an independent domain and stretches out on the virion surface that can elicit type-specific neutralizing antibodies. For recombinant DIII vaccine development, prime-boost immunizations can provide an advantage of eliciting more type-specific neutralizing antibodies by recalling DIII antigens after DIII booster to improve protection. Methods: The DIII of the E genes of DENV and ZIKV were fused with bacterial fliC gene for the expression of flagellin-DIII (FliC-DIII) fusion proteins. Prime-boost immunization strategies by the second-dose booster of four DENV serotype or ZIKV FliC-DIII fusion proteins were used to investigate the induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection against viral infections. Cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies in each group of antisera were also examined using in vitro antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay. A series of glycan-masking E antigens were finally constructed for prime-boost immunizations to abolish the elicitation of cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies for ADE activity. Results: We showed that inclusion of a bivalent live-attenuated vaccine with a FliC-DIII booster is superior in eliciting neutralization titers and protection in vivo against all four-serotype DENVs. We also demonstrated that recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding four-serotype DENV prMEs with a FliC-DIII prime-boost scheme is capable of eliciting good antibody responses. In contract, recombinant adenovirus vector of ZIKV prME gene priming, followed by ZIKV FliC-DIII booster did not improve vaccine efficacy. The glycan-masking mutation on the ZIKV E protein ij loop (E-248NHT), but not on DENV2 E protein ij loop (E-242NHT), resulted in abolishing the elicitation of cross-reactive antibodies for DENV and ZIKV infection enhancements. Conclusions: Our findings can provide useful information for designing novel immunogens and vaccination strategies in an attempt to develop a safe and efficacious DENV or ZIKV vaccine. <br>	1901	338	12
Risk assessment of dengue autochthonous infections in Tokyo in summer, especially in the period of the 2020 Olympic Games.	In Tokyo, Japan, an outbreak of autochthonous dengue fever occurred in summer of 2014. In summer of 2020, when the Olympic Games will be held, a lot of participants and spectators from abroad will visit Tokyo. This study is aiming at analyzing a risk of autochthonous dengue infections in Tokyo in summer and also an additional risk in the Olympiad by using a mathematical model. We developed a stochastic transmission model with the cooperation of seasonal factors which influence much on the transmission cycle of dengue virus, and carried out stochastic simulations for each of the scenarios provided adequately. We found that (1) the incidence of dengue autochthonous infections is predicted to be small number cases; (2) the local climate makes a great influence on a scale of dengue autochthonous infections; (3) the incidence reaches a peak in August and early September; and (4) there is a bare possibility of development into dengue outbreak. In the Olympiad held in summer of 2020, an additional risk of dengue autochthonous infections will amount to about the double of risk in normal years. <br>	928	182	5
Low to medium-low risk perception for dengue, chikungunya and Zika outbreaks by infectious diseases physicians in France, Western Europe.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMany tropical countries are currently experiencing dengue (DEN), chikungunya (CHIK) and also more recently Zika (ZIKA) epidemics (particularly in Latin America). Although the risk of transmission and spread of these infections in temperate regions remains a controversial issue, vector-borne diseases have been widely reported in the media and have been the focus of preventive strategies by national and international policy-makers and public health authorities. In this context, we wanted to determine the extent of risk perception in infectious diseases (ID) physicians of the current and future risk of arboviral disease introduction, autochthonous case development and epidemic scenarios in France, Western Europe. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo this aim, we developed an original standardized questionnaire survey which was disseminated by the French Infectious Diseases Society to ID physician members. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe found that ID physicians perceived the risk of introduction and outbreak development of DEN, CHIK and ZIKA in France to be low to medium-low. Generalized Linear Model(s) identified medical school training, the extent of professional experience, and awareness of the French national plan regarding arboviral infections as significant predictors for lower risk perception among respondents. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDespite the fact that arboviral diseases are increasingly being imported into France, sometimes resulting in sporadic autochtonous transmission, French ID physicians do not perceive the risk as high. Better communication and education targeting health professionals and citizens will be needed to enhance the effectiveness of the French national plan to prepare against arboviral diseases. <br>	1434	735	8
Larvicidal activity of essential oil from Vitex negundo and Vitex trifolia on dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe ability of Vitex trifolia and Vitex negundo essential oils to kill Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus larvae was evaluated. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe larvae were treated with their respective essential oils at 50-125 ppm concentration. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLC50 and LC90 for V. trifolia against Ae. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus, and those for V. negundo against Ae. aegypti were 57.7+0.4, 77.9+0.9 ppm and 55.17+3.14, 78.28+2.23 ppm, and 50.86+0.9, 73.12+1.3 ppm, respectively. Eucalyptol and caryophyllene were the major components in Vitex trifolia and Vitex negundo essential oil, respectively. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study revealed potential larvicidal properties of essential oil from V. trifolia. <br>	565	352	11
A review of dengue diagnostics and implications for surveillance and control.	Dengue is the world's most common arboviral infection, with almost 4 billion people estimated to be living at risk of dengue infection. A recently introduced vaccine is currently recommended only for seropositive individuals in a restricted age range determined by transmission intensity. With no effective dengue vaccine for the general population or any antiviral therapy, dengue control continues to rely heavily on vector control measures. Early and accurate diagnosis is important for guiding appropriate management and for disease surveillance to guide prompt dengue control interventions. However, major uncertainties exist in dengue diagnosis and this has important implications for all three. Dengue can be diagnosed clinically against predefined lists of signs and symptoms and by detection of dengue-specific antibodies, non-structural 1 antigen or viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. All of these methods have their limitations. This review aims to describe and quantify the advantages, uncertainties and variability of the various diagnostic methods used for dengue and discuss their implications and applications for dengue surveillance and control. <br>	1028	173	8

Spatial diffusion of the 2015-2016 Zika, dengue and chikungunya epidemics in Rio de Janeiro Municipality, Brazil.	Different countries, especially Brazil, that have faced recurrent dengue epidemics for decades and chikungunya epidemics since 2014, have had to restructure their health services to combat a triple epidemic of arboviruses - Zika, dengue and Chikungunya - transmitted by the same vector, mainly Aedes aegypti, in 2015-2016. Several efforts have been made to better understand these three arboviruses. Spatial analysis plays an important role in the knowledge of disease dynamics. The knowledge of the patterns of spatial diffusion of these three arboviruses during an epidemic can contribute to the planning of surveillance actions and control of these diseases. This study aimed to identify the spatial diffusion processes of these viruses in the context of the triple epidemic in 2015-2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Two study designs were used: cross-sectional and ecological. Sequential Kernel maps, nearest-neighbour ratios calculated cumulatively over time, Moran global autocorrelation correlograms, and local autocorrelation changes over time were used to identify spatial diffusion patterns. The results suggested an expansion diffusion pattern for the three arboviruses during 2015-2016 in Rio de Janeiro. These findings can be considered for more effective control measures and for new studies on the dynamics of these three arboviruses. <br>	1157	201	8
Prior Dengue Virus Infection Is Associated With Increased Viral Load in Patients Infected With Dengue but Not Zika Virus.	To evaluate potential enhancement of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection among patients with prior dengue virus (DENV) infection, we compared loads of viral RNA among patients infected with ZIKV (n = 1070), DENV-2 (n = 312), or DENV-3 (n = 260). Compared to patients without prior DENV infection, patients with prior DENV infection had significantly higher mean loads of viral RNA if infected with DENV-2 (10.6 vs 11.6 log10 GCE/mL, respectively; t test, P < .0001) or DENV-3 (10.3 vs 10.9 log10 GCE/mL; P < .0001), but not ZIKV (4.7 vs 4.7 log10 GCE/mL; P = .959). These findings provide evidence against in vivo enhancement of ZIKV by anti-DENV antibodies. <br>	547	119	3
Disease-Specific IgG Fc Glycosylation Ratios as Personalized Biomarkers to Differentiate Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer From Benign Lung Diseases.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe authors aimed to separate Fc N-glycopeptides of disease-specific immunoglobulin G (DSIgG) as personalized biomarkers to distinguish non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from benign lung diseases (BLDs). <br><b>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDSIgG from 509 BLDs patients and 477 NSCLC patients was isolated using native-PAGE and then the Fc glycosylation was determined using mass spectrometry. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIncrease in the ratios of G1F/G1 of DSIgG1 and of G1F/G1, G2F/G2, G1FS/G1F, G2FS/G2F of DSIgG2 and decrease in the ratio of G1F/G0F of DSIgG1 in NSCLC patients were detected compared with BLDs patients. For the patients below 60 years of age, a combination of the glycopeptides ratios with one fucose residue difference of DSIgG1 (G1F/G1) and DSIgG2 (G1FS/G1S and G1F/G1) can differentiate NSCLC from BLDs, with AUC values of >0.76, sensitivities of >87%, and specificities of> 61%. For the patients above 60 years of age, a combination of the glycopeptides ratios with one monosaccharide residue of DSIgG2 (G2F/G2, G1FS/G1S, and G1FS/G1F) can differentiate NSCLC from BLDs, with AUC values of > 0.78, sensitivities of> 91%, and specificities of >54%. For the same participants, the commonly used biomarkers (CEA, CYFRA 21-1, SCCA, NSE, or ProGRP) have AUC of 0.5-0.621, sensitivities of 15.8-32.9%, and specificities of 75.7-90.5%. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese findings indicate that these DSIgG Fc glycoforms are potential personalized biomarkers to differentiate NSCLC from BLDs. <br><b>CLINICAL RELEVANCE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHow to distinguish different physiopathological states remains a challenge. We have applied native-PAGE to separate disease-specific immunoglobulin G (DSIgG) and have identified Fc N-glycopeptides of DSIgG. These glycopeptides can serve as personalized biomarkers to distinguish non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from benign lung diseases (BLDs). This article is protected by copyright.

Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index as a prognostic marker in patients with extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer: Results from a randomized controlled trial.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClinical impact of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) in patients with extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) have not previously been reported. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study analyzed 352 patients enrolled in a previous randomized phase III trial comparing the efficacy of irinotecan plus cisplatin with that of etoposide plus cisplatin as the first-line therapy for ED-SCLC. GNRI values were calculated using serum albumin levels and actual and ideal bodyweights. Patients with a GNRI > 98, 92-98, and <92 were grouped into no, low, and moderate/major risk groups, respectively. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe objective response rates were 63.2%, 52.6%, and 49.2% in the no, low, and moderate/major risk groups, respectively (P = 0.024). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was shorter in patients with a lower GNRI than in those with a higher GNRI (no vs. low vs. moderate/major risk group; 6.5 vs. 5.8 vs. 5.9 months, respectively; P = 0.028). There were significant differences in median overall survival (OS) according to GNRI (no vs. low vs. moderate/major risk group; 13.2 vs. 10.3 vs. 8.4 months, respectively; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that being in the moderate/major risk group was an independent poor prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.300, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.012-1.670; P = 0.040) and OS (HR: 1.539; 95% CI: 1.069-2.216; P = 0.020). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis prospective study shows that a low GNRI value was associated with a poor prognosis, and it supports the relationship between systemic inflammation, nutritional status, and clinical outcomes in patients with ED-SCLC.Key points SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The lower GNRI group had a low response rate to chemotherapy for ED-SCLC. The HRs for PFS and OS were 1.300 and 1.539 in the patients with GNRI < 92. <br><b>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLow GNRI is associated with poor prognosis in ED-SCLC. <br>	1561	1127	18
Testicular Cancer: A Thirteen-year Retrospective Review of Ethnic Disparities in the Waikato Region, New Zealand.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe testicular cancer incidence in New Zealand is rising. We evaluated if testicular cancer outcomes differed by ethnicity in NZ. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRetrospective review of testicular cancer cases in the Medical Oncology database, Waikato Hospital, between 2001 and 2013 inclusive. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp325 patients were seen, with median follow-up of survivors being 101 (range 13-230) months. 95 (29.2%) were MĀori, 210 (64.6%) NZ European and 20 (6.1%) of other ethnicity. 182 patients were diagnosed with seminoma and 143 with non-seminoma. MĀori represented 27.5% of seminoma and 31.4% of non-seminoma patients. Median age at diagnosis was 39 years for seminoma and 30 years for non-seminoma; MĀori were significantly younger than non- MĀori for both seminoma (median age 35 versus 42 years) and non-seminoma (median age 28 versus 34 years respectively). While stage distribution of seminoma at diagnosis was similar for MĀori and non-MĀori (chi-squared p = 0.31), significantly more MĀori had higher-stage non-seminoma than non-MĀori (stage III in 44% and 22% respectively, chi-squared p = 0.014). Survival for seminoma (logrank p = 0.19) and non-seminoma (logrank p = 0.89) patients did not differ significantly by ethnicity. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMĀori patients were younger at diagnosis of testicular cancer and presented with more advanced non-seminoma testicular tumours compared to non-MĀori but survival was comparable.

Colonoscopy resource availability and its association with the colorectal cancer diagnostic interval: A population-based cross-sectional study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspColonoscopy is a key resource used to diagnose colorectal cancer (CRC). This study evaluated the relationship between colonoscopy availability and the length of the CRC diagnostic interval. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a cross-sectional study of CRC patients diagnosed in Ontario, Canada, in 2008-2012. We used administrative health data to characterise colonoscopist density, private colonoscopy clinic access, distance to the closest colonoscopist and the diagnostic interval, defined as the time from patients' first cancer-related healthcare encounter to their cancer diagnosis date. We used multivariable quantile regression to evaluate the association between colonoscopy availability and the diagnostic interval, modelling the median and 90th percentile. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe median diagnostic interval was 84 days (90th percentile 323 days). The diagnostic interval was longer in patients residing in areas with lower colonoscopists density or private clinic access (adjusted median difference = 9 and 19 days, respectively), with evidence of effect modification by symptom status. Increased distance to a colonoscopist was associated with a longer diagnostic interval in asymptomatic patients, but a shorter diagnostic interval in symptomatic patients (adjusted median difference = 29 and -25 days, respectively). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study demonstrated that reduced colonoscopy resource availability is associated with longer diagnostic intervals for CRC patients. <br>	1230	589	8
Long-term survival and renal dysfunction in a patient with recurrent colorectal cancer treated with Bevacizumab.	Advances in cancer chemotherapy have increased the opportunities of treating patients with cancer with renal dysfunction. Here we report the case of a 64-year-old woman with recurrent colorectal cancer who was treated with bevacizumab (BEV) combination chemotherapy. Although proteinuria caused by BEV developed early during the treatment and her renal function gradually deteriorated, BEV combination chemotherapy could be continued for 48 cycles over 2.5 years for controlling disease progression without other adverse events such as hypertension, decreased serum albumin level, or edema. After BEV discontinuation, proteinuria gradually improved and further renal function deterioration was not observed. Because the therapeutic options available for metastatic colorectal cancer are limited, balancing the risks and benefits of continuing chemotherapy is important in cases of adverse events. <br>	780	127	5
Self-reported depression in cancer survivors versus the general population: a population-based propensity score-matching analysis.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe purpose of the study was to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depression in community-dwelling cancer survivors using structured questionnaires and propensity score matching (PSM). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSubjects (age ≥ 30 years) who participated in the Sixth Korean National Health and Nutritional Exam Survey completed the EuroQoL5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). For the analysis, participants were divided into a cancer survivor group and a group consisting of the general cancer-free population. We compared PHQ-9 and EQ-5D Utility Index scores between the two groups, while controlling for underlying baseline demographic and clinical differences between groups using PSM. Additionally, we divided cancer survivors into two group (< 5 vs. ≥ 5 years since cancer diagnosis), and we evaluated whether the cancer prevalence period was associated with the EQ-5D Utility Index score. <br><b>RESULT:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOf all 4124 subjects, 208 cancer survivors were matched with 624 controls using PSM. PHQ-9 and EQ-5D scores in cancer survivors were not different from the general population. In unadjusted subgroup analyses, PHQ-9 scores and EQ-5D proportion of subjects with anxiety/depression (23.3% vs. 7.6%) were higher in cancer survivors with < 5 years since cancer diagnosis compared to those with ≥ 5 years. In multivariate analyses, predictors of depression in cancer survivors included household income and employment status, and predictors of HRQoL-included household income and subjective perceived health status. Period since the cancer diagnosis was not a predictor of either depression or HRQoL. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDepression and HRQoL in cancer survivors were similar to that experienced by the general population, and household income, perceived subjective health status and employment status were the main factors affecting depression and HRQoL in cancer survivors. <br>	1595	778	13
A phase 1 dose-escalation study of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor prexasertib in combination with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) inhibitor ralimetinib in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer.	Purpose The primary objective was to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitor, prexasertib, in combination with the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, ralimetinib, which may be safely administered to patients with advanced cancer. Methods This Phase 1, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation study of prexasertib+ralimetinib included patients with advanced and/or metastatic cancer, followed by a planned cohort expansion in patients with colorectal or non-small-cell lung cancer with KRAS and/or BRAF mutations. Intravenous prexasertib was administered at 60 mg/m2 (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle), together with oral ralimetinib every 12 h (days 1 to 14 at 100 mg [Cohort 1, n = 3] or 200 mg [Cohort 2, n = 6]). Dose escalations for each agent were planned using a model-based 3 + 3 escalation paradigm. Safety was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0X. Tumor response was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Results Nine patients were treated; 3 experienced dose-limiting toxicities, all in Cohort 2, prohibiting further dose escalation. The most common ≥Grade 3 adverse event was neutrophil count decreased; other reported ≥Grade 3 hematological toxicities included febrile neutropenia and anemia. The pharmacokinetics of prexasertib+ralimetinib was comparable to the monotherapy population profile for each agent. One patient achieved a best overall response of stable disease (for 2 cycles); there were no complete/partial responses. Conclusions This study did not achieve its primary objective of establishing an RP2D of combination prexasertib + ralimetinib that could be safely administered to patients with advanced cancer. <br>	1515	270	10
Replication-Competent Lentivirus Analysis of Vector-Transduced T Cell Products Used in Cancer Immunotherapy Clinical Trials.	Lentiviral vectors are being used in a growing number of clinical applications, including T cell immunotherapy for cancer. As this new technology moves forward, a safety concern is the inadvertent recombination and subsequent development of a replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) during the manufacture of the vector material. To assess this risk, regulators have required screening of T cell products infused into patients for RCL. Since vector particles have many of the proteins and nucleotide sequences found in RCL, a biologic assay has proven the most sensitive method for RCL detection. As regulators have required screening of up to 108 cells per T cell product, this method described a procedure for assessing RCL contamination of large-volume T cell products. <br>	660	121	5
CAR-T Cells for Cancer Treatment: Current Design and Next Frontiers.	Immunotherapy has been growing in the past decade as a therapeutic alternative for cancer treatment. In this chapter, we deal with CAR-T cells, genetically engineered autologous T cells to express a chimeric receptor specific for an antigen expressed on tumor cell surface. While this type of personalized therapy is revolutionizing cancer treatment, especially B cell malignancies, it has some challenging limitations. Here, we discuss the basic immunological and technological aspects of CAR-T cell therapy, the limitations that have compromised its efficacy and safety, and the current proposed strategies to overcome these limitations, thereby allowing for greater therapeutic application of CAR-T cells. <br>	613	106	4
Repetitive Cancer Training for Community Healthcare Workers: an Effective Method to Strengthen Knowledge and Impact on the Communities: Results from a Pilot Training at Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania.	Cancer is a growing burden in Tanzania with high mortality rates. Low level of cancer awareness in the population and health workforce is one of the reasons. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a cancer awareness training for community-level healthcare providers in Kilimanjaro Region. Main research interest was to assess the effects of the training on cancer knowledge of the healthcare workers and its application into practice. Community health workers (CHWs) (n = 25) and dispensary healthcare workers (DHCWs) (n = 16) attended cancer awareness trainings. Three training days over a 3-month period were provided for each group. Pre- and post-training assessments of the cancer knowledge were conducted on each training day. Application of the knowledge into practice was assessed at follow-up and complemented with qualitative data. Analysis of the questionnaires was provided by descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analyzed by semantic thematic analysis. Both groups showed a statistically significant increase in knowledge after the three training days: CHWs + 10% (CI 95% = 2-18%, p = 0.015) and DHCWs 24.4% (CI 95% = 13-36%, p = 0.002). The community-level healthcare providers also started to apply the new cancer knowledge into practice and reported to feel more confident in cancer control. The pilot cancer awareness training was effective in increasing cancer knowledge and its application. It strengthened their confidence in care delivery and referral practices as well as education of the population. This concept of cancer awareness training might be also applicable to other countries in SSA. <br>	1386	254	15
An Assessment of Cancer Education Needs to Promote Mid-Adult HPV Vaccination Among Male Sexual Minorities.	The purpose of this study was to assess behavioral expectations and related psychosocial factors regarding an age-expanded human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine schedule among male sexual minorities (MSM). A measure of behavioral expectation (BE) ("How likely are you to get the HPV vaccine if the CDC recommendation was changed to include men older than 26?") was evaluated on an ethnoracially diverse sample (N = 318) of MSM. Sixty-seven percent would likely initiate vaccination if the recommendations change. Benefits of HPV vaccination were widely endorsed. Barriers/harms of vaccination were endorsed less frequently. Only 15.4% were concerned that the vaccine would not be effective. The main driver of BE was perceived physical benefits (R2 = 0.34). Psychological benefits were independently associated with BE but did not improve the explanatory model. Expectation of HPV vaccination is high among MSM in the expanded age range. Prevention of anogenital warts and anal cancer is an important consideration for this population; however, promoting the benefits of vaccination must be done in accordance with realistic expectations of vaccine efficacy in older sexually active MSM. <br>	1014	181	10
Harnessing Digital Videos to Promote Cancer Prevention and Education: a Systematic Review of the Literature from 2013-2018.	Social media has transformed the way cancer patients search for information about their chronic health problems. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify the use of online digital videos to increase cancer knowledge and to understand information preference, behavioral changes, and attitudes towards online cancer education videos. The databases used for this review included MedLine, PsychINFO, and PubMed. These medical databases were used to locate peer-reviewed academic journals from 2013-2018 using the following MeSH terms: "cancer education videos," "cancer prevention videos," and "cancer education digital videos." A total of 4996 articles were retrieved from the initial search, and 33 articles were reviewed. Articles were excluded if videos did not (1) focus on cancer education and prevention; (2) posted on an online platform; and (3) assessed participants' knowledge, attitude, or beliefs about cancer. Eleven articles were found to meet inclusion criteria for final review. All of the studies focused on increasing education on preventive health behaviors (i.e., sunscreen use, smoking, and diet) and/or early detection strategies (i.e., screening testing and/or self-skin exams). While online digital health videos have the potential to improve health outcomes, issues related to technology access and health literacy must be considered when developing online health education videos. <br>	1218	211	8
Evaluation of the relationship between the IL-17A gene expression level and regulatory miRNA-9 in relation to tumor progression in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a pilot study.	A pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with increased risk of developing numerous cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). IL-17A is a target gene for miR-9. This encouraged us to analyze these two genes in terms of their usefulness as prognostic markers in NSCLC. The expression levels of IL-17A gene and miR-9 was assessed in 26 NSCLC tissue samples and 26 unchanged lung tissue adjacent to lung tumors (control tissue), using qPCR. In both tissue groups, a decreased expression of IL-17A was observed in 100% of samples. Increased expression of miRNA-9 was observed in 92% of tumor samples, and in 100% of control samples. Neither statistical differences in the level of expression IL-17A depending on the patient's age, gender, smoking status, nor histopathology of the cancer was found. Regarding the presence of nodule metastasis ('N' value in TNM classification), significantly lower expression level of IL-17A was observed in cN2 as compared with cN1 group. Additionally, statistically lower IL-17A expression was found in III versus II tumor stage (cAJCC classification). Significant negative correlation between both studied genes was revealed in SCC subgroup. This leads to the conclusion that miRNA-9 can regulate the expression of IL-17A as an IL-17A mRNA antagonistic mediator. Inhibition of proinflammatory action of IL-17A in correlation with tumor progression can be related to various activity of Th17 cells on cancer development according to its immunogenicity, and also may suggest suppressive role of IL-17A in tumor progression. However, because of low number of analyzed samples, further studies on the functional role of IL-17A in development and/or progression NSCLC seem warranted. <br>	1478	283	13
Emerging immune gene signatures as prognostic or predictive biomarkers in breast cancer.	Several multigene assays have been developed to predict the risk of distant recurrence and response to adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer. However, the prognostic or predictive value of current proliferation gene signature-based assays are limited to hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) early breast cancer. Considerable discordance between the different assays in classifying patients into risk groups has also been reported, thus raising questions about the clinical utility of these assays for individual patients. Therefore, there still remains a need for better prognostic or predictive biomarkers for breast cancer. The role of immune cells comprising tumor microenvironment in tumor progression has been recognized. Accumulating evidences have shown that immune gene signatures and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can be prognostic or predictive factors in breast cancer, particularly with regard to HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer. In this review, I summarize current multigene assays for breast cancer and discuss recent progress in identifying novel breast cancer biomarkers, focusing on the emerging importance of immune gene signatures and TILs as prognostic or predictive biomarkers. <br>	1100	182	7
Meta-analysis of deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) versus free breathing (FB) in postoperative radiotherapy for left-side breast cancer.	<b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis meta-analysis evaluates the difference in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) versus free breathing (FB) for patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy for left breast cancer and provides a useful reference for clinical practice. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe relevant controlled trials of DIBH versus FB in postoperative radiotherapy for left-side breast cancer were retrieved from the databases of PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. The principal outcome of interest was heart dose, left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA) dose, and left lung dose and target coverage. We calculated summary standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe analysis included 1019 patients from 12 observational studies, of which 576 cases were in the DIBH group and 443 cases in the FB group. Compared with the FB group, the DIBH group can have lower heart dose, left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA) dose, and left lung dose more effectively, and the difference was statistically significant (heart dose, SMD = - 1.36, 95% CI - 1.64 ~ - 1.09, P < 0.01. LADCA dose, SMD = - 1.45, 95% CI - 1.62 ~ - 1.27, P < 0.01. Left lung dose, SMD = - 0.52, 95% CI - 0.81 ~ - 0.23, P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in target coverage between the two groups (SMD = 0.03, 95% CI - 0.11 ~ 0.18, P = 0.64). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBy this meta-analysis, we found that implementation of DIBH in postoperative radiotherapy for left-side breast cancer can reduce irradiation of heart dose, LADCA dose and left lung dose, without compromising target coverage. <br>	1373	726	9
Survival and costs of colorectal cancer treatment and effects of changing treatment strategies: a model approach.	New and emerging advances in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment combined with limited healthcare resources highlight the need for detailed decision-analytic models to evaluate costs, survival and quality-adjusted life years. The objectives of this article were to estimate the expected lifetime treatment cost of CRC for an average 70-year-old patient and to test the applicability and flexibility of a model in predicting survival and costs of changing treatment scenarios. The analyses were based on a validated semi-Markov model using data from a Norwegian observational study (2049 CRC patients) to estimate transition probabilities and the proportion resected. In addition, inputs from the Norwegian Patient Registry, guidelines, literature, and expert opinions were used to estimate resource use. We found that the expected lifetime treatment cost for a 70-year-old CRC patient was €47,300 (CRC stage I €26,630, II €38,130, III €56,800, and IV €69,890). Altered use of palliative chemotherapy would increase the costs by up to 29%. A 5% point reduction in recurrence rate for stages I-III would reduce the costs by 5.3% and increase overall survival by 8.2 months. Given the Norwegian willingness to pay threshold per QALY gained, society's willingness to pay for interventions that could result in such a reduction was on average €28,540 per CRC patient. The life years gained by CRC treatment were 6.05 years. The overall CRC treatment costs appear to be low compared to the health gain, and the use of palliative chemotherapy can have a major impact on cost. The model was found to be flexible and applicable for estimating the cost and survival of several CRC treatment scenarios. <br>	1432	283	11
A model of cancer survivorship care within a community health setting: the Good Life Cancer Survivorship program.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study aimed to establish and evaluate the referral pathway from a hospital-based oncology service to a multidisciplinary community-based health service supporting survivors to engage in self-management. <br><b>METHOD:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe evaluation involved understanding patterns of health service utilisation and health professionals' perspectives on the implementation of the community-based model of survivorship care, the Good Life Cancer Survivorship (GLCS) program. Survivors referred to GLCS were undergoing or had completed cancer treatment and unable to participate in intensive ambulatory oncology rehabilitation. Health service utilisation was tracked over 5 months, and the perspectives of health professionals referring to and involved in the GLCS program were recorded using semi-structured interviews. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe oncology service made 25 referrals. The most accessed services at Carrington Health were physiotherapy with 18 appointments, followed by psychology (12) and dietitian services (11). Four themes emerged from the interviews: (1) Allied health services are relevant to people with cancer; (2) Education and information needs; (3) Communication gaps; (4) A one-stop multidisciplinary and holistic care model. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis project demonstrated that community health may be a valid setting to support cancer survivors in managing their health. Supporting ongoing awareness, education and understanding of services across both community and acute care settings will foster care coordination and strengthen referral pathways. <br><b>IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAccessing appropriate community-based allied health services can support cancer survivors in developing self-management skills to manage their own health and improve their health outcomes and wellbeing in the survivorship phase. <br>	1506	887	10
Association between cardiorespiratory fitness and colorectal cancer in the UK Biobank.	Increased cardiorespiratory fitness is related to decreased risk of major chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer, but its association with colorectal cancer specifically has received very little attention. We examined the relation of cardiorespiratory fitness to colorectal cancer in 59,191 UK Biobank participants aged 39-70 years without prevalent cancer at baseline, followed from 2009 to 2014. Submaximal bicycle ergometry was conducted at study entry, and cardiorespiratory fitness was defined as physical work capacity at 75% of the maximum heart rate, standardised to body mass (PWC75%). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to obtain hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). During a mean follow-up of 4.6 years, 232 participants developed colorectal cancer (151 colon cancers; 79 rectal cancers). When comparing the 75th to the 25th percentiles of PWC75%, the multivariable-adjusted HR of colorectal cancer was 0.78 (95% CI 0.62-0.97). That relation was largely driven by an inverse association with colon cancer (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.97) and less so with rectal cancer (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62-1.26; p value for difference by colorectal cancer endpoint = 0.056). The inverse relation of cardiorespiratory fitness with colorectal cancer was more evident in men (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.94) than women (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.71-1.38), although the gender difference was not statistically significant (p value for interaction = 0.192). Increased cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer. Potential heterogeneity by colorectal cancer anatomic subsite and gender requires further study. <br>	1480	274	9
Brain Metastases as a First Site of Recurrence in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy with Controlled Systemic Cancer: a Critical but Under-Recognized Clinical Scenario.	<b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs the treatment of many malignancies has improved, brain metastases (BM) have been observed as a site of the first recurrence in patients with controlled systemic cancers. This suggests that while the administered chemotherapy is effective against systemic cancer, drug concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS) are likely too low to be effective. These findings are in accord with data suggesting that more than 98% of FDA-approved drugs on the market today are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). <br><b>RECENT FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis retrospective literature review was conducted to estimate the proportion of patients with non-small lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma who develop BM as their initial site of recurrence while their systemic cancers are well controlled. Of 267 studies screened, 12 studies fit criteria for inclusion. These 12 studies reported on 923 patients. According to compiled data across these studies, 16% of patients on chemotherapy with stable or responding systemic cancer developed isolated BM as their initial site of relapse. These findings strongly suggest that while chemotherapy controlled systemic cancer, drug concentrations within the CNS were low enough to allow disease progression. Ultimately, reducing the incidence of BM in these patients will require novel therapeutic approaches that facilitate drug entry through an intact BBB early in their treatment. <br>	1187	326	9
25-Hydroxyvitamin D at time of breast cancer diagnosis and breast cancer survival.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPrevious studies have shown that low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) are associated with a poorer breast cancer survival. The relationship between vitamin D status and breast cancer outcomes is however still debated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between 25(OH)D blood levels measured at time of diagnosis and event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in a large cohort of patients with early-stage primary invasive breast cancer. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom April 2008 to April 2013, 25(OH)D status was measured at time of diagnosis in all women operated for early stage primary invasive breast cancer at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. Associations between 25(OH)D and EFS and OS were investigated using a Cox Proportional hazards model, adjusting for age, disease characteristics, time period, and BMI. Differences in survival were evaluated by hazard ratios (HR). <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the present study, 2510 women with primary invasive breast cancer were included. Women with the lowest 25(OH)D levels (≤ 52 nmol/L) had an inferior EFS with a HR of 1.63 (95% CI 1.21-2.19) compared to women in the third quartile (76-99 nmol/L). Women with the highest 25(OH)D levels (≥ 99 nmol/L) also had an inferior EFS with a HR of 1.37 (95% CI 1.02-1.83). Plotting 25(OH)D status against EFS, the association was inversely J-shaped. For OS, a similar association with 25(OH)D status was observed. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe confirmed previous findings suggesting that a low 25(OH)D status is associated with an inferior breast cancer survival, but unlike previous findings, we found an indication of poorer breast cancer survival also among women with high 25(OH)D levels. <br>	1404	852	12
Clinicopathological significance of lipocalin 2 nuclear expression in invasive breast cancer.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is involved in the regulation of EMT. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance of LCN2 expression in breast cancer. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe expression of LCN2 protein was immunohistochemically assessed in two well-characterised annotated cohorts of breast cancer (discovery cohort, n = 612; validation cohort, n = 1363). The relationship of LCN2 expression and subcellular location with the clinicopathological factors and outcomes of patients was analysed. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAbsent or reduced nuclear LCN2 expression was associated with features of aggressive behaviour, including high histological grade, high Nottingham Prognostic Index, high Ki67 labelling index, hormone receptor negativity and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity. The high cytoplasmic expression of LCN2 was correlated with lymph node positivity. The nuclear downregulation of LCN2 was correlated with the overexpression of EMT associated proteins (N-cadherin and Twist-related protein 2) and basal biomarkers (cytokeratin 5/6 and epidermal growth factor receptor). Unlike the cytoplasmic expression of LCN2, the loss of nuclear expression was a significant predictor of poor outcome. The combinatorial expression tumours with high cytoplasmic and low nuclear expression were associated with the worst prognosis. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTumour cell expression of LCN2 plays a role in breast cancer progression with loss of its nuclear expression which is associated with aggressive features and poor outcome. Further functional analysis is warranted to confirm the relationship between the subcellular localisation LCN2 and behaviour of breast cancer. <br>	1502	657	12
Longitudinal dyadic interdependence in psychological distress among Latinas with breast cancer and their caregivers.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCancer diagnosis and treatment can generate substantial distress for both survivors and their family caregivers. The primary aim of this investigation is to test a model of dyadic interdependence in distress experienced by cancer survivors and their caregivers to determine if each influences the other. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo test this prediction, 209 Latinas with breast cancer and their family caregivers (dyads) were followed for 4 waves of assessment over the course of 6 months. Both psychological (depression, anxiety, perceived stress) and physical (number of symptoms, symptom distress) indicators of distress were assessed. Longitudinal analyses of dyadic data were performed in accordance with the actor-partner interdependence model. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFindings indicated that psychological distress was interdependent between cancer survivors and their caregivers over the 6 months of observation. However, there was no such evidence of interdependence on indicators of physical distress. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese findings are consistent with emotional contagion processes and point to the potential importance of caregiver well-being for the welfare of Latina breast cancer survivors. <br>	984	534	8
Apoptotic effect of fluoxetine through the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in the human gastric cancer cell line AGS.	Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the world. Fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can inhibit the growth of cancer cells by inducing apoptotic cell death through various signaling pathways. This study was aimed to determine the mechanism of apoptotic cell death induced by FLX in AGS cells. MTT assay for cell viability test and colony forming assay was performed for detection of cell proliferation. Western blot analysis was conducted for protein expression. Increased fluorescence intensity and chromatin condensation were observed using DAPI staining. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by DCFDA assay. AGS cell proliferation was remarkedly inhibited by FLX in a dose-dependent manner starting at a concentration of 20 μM. The expression of death receptors was increased, which resulted in elevated expression of activated caspases and cleaved PARP, leading to FLX-induced apoptosis. Moreover, FLX significantly increased production of ROS, and N-acetyl cysteine, which scavenges ROS, attenuated the cytotoxic effects of FLX. In addition, treatment with FLX increased the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker, CHOP. P53 protein expression in AGS cells also decreased significantly with FLX treatment. Inhibition of ER stress significantly decreased the expressions of death receptor 5 (DR5), cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved PARP, but not to control levels. FLX-induced apoptosis in AGS involved upregulation of death receptors, ROS generation, and activation of ER stress. <br>	1338	233	14
Assessment of the impact of 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines in management of differentiated thyroid cancer patients.	The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guideline have suggested modifications in the risk stratification (RS) for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients, introduced the concept of dynamic risk stratification (DRS) and redefined the role of radioactive iodine (RAI) in treatment algorithm. The aim of this retrospective audit was to assess the practical implications of these modifications in management of DTC. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 138 DTC patients were stratified according to ATA 2009 and 2015 guidelines into low (LR), intermediate (IR) and high (HR) risk groups. Change in RS and in intention of RAI use was calculated. Deviation in administered RAI dosage from the guidelines was assessed. 1-year follow-up data was audited to assess how the DRS modified the initial risk estimate. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 11.6% of patients changed their RS categories in 2015 guidelines. A total of 10.1% got upstaged to HR, and 1.4% got downstaged to LR. In 2.17% of patients' intention of RAI use changed to remnant ablation from adjuvant therapy and 65% of the LR patients won't require any RAI therapy. A total of 26.7% of patients had received significantly more RAI dosage according to ATA 2015. At 1-year follow-up according to DRS 84% of LR, 75% of IR and 44% of HR patients showed excellent response (ER). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMore patients changed RS to HR than to LR. Intention of RAI use changed in only a small number of patients. Significantly higher dosage of RAI is being administered to patients in current practice. The effect of DRS in modifying the initial RS was most prominent in IR, with most showing ER to initial therapy. <br>	1346	732	14
Anti-Proliferative Effect of Wogonin on Ovary Cancer Cells Involves Activation of Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest.	BACKGROUND The present study was designed to investigate the effect of wogonin on Caov-3 and A2780 ovary cancer cell proliferation and the mechanisms involved. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cell viability changes and apoptosis induction by wogonin were assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenytetrazolium bromide) assay and fluorescence microscopy. Morphological examination of cells was performed using transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS Wogonin exhibited inhibitory effect on Caov-3 and A2780 cancer cell proliferation in a concentration-based manner. Caov-3 and A2780 cell proliferation was reduced to 18% and 21%, respectively on treatment with 200 μM concentration of wogonin. Treatment with wogonin significantly enhanced the percentage of A2780 cells showing apoptosis. The nuclear membrane degradation and condensation of chromatin material was evident in A2780 cells on treatment with wogonin. Treatment of A2780 cells with wogonin suppressed the migration potential significantly. The proportion of A2780 cells in G1/G0 phase was markedly raised on exposure to wogonin for 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS In summary, this study demonstrated that wogonin acts as an ovary cancer cell proliferation inhibiting agent through activation of apoptosis. Wogonin, therefore, can be investigated further for the development of ovary cancer treatment. <br>	1178	199	11
Expression of mTOR Signaling Pathway Molecules in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), currently has no effective hormonal or molecular target therapy. <br><b>OBJECTIVE AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo elucidate the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in TNBC, the expression of molecules involved in mTOR signaling including mTOR, phosphorylated (p)-mTOR, p-4EBP1, GLUT1, GLUT3, HIF-1α, and Ki67 was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 35 TNBC and 81 non-TNBC cases. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExpression of p-mTOR, the activated form of mTOR, but not unphosphorylated mTOR, was significantly higher in non-TNBC cases than in TNBC cases. Expression of p-4EBP1, GLUT1, and GLUT3 was higher in TNBC cases than in non-TNBC cases. When the localization of p-mTOR was classified as nuclear, perinuclear, or cytoplasmic, nuclear localization of p-mTOR was observed more frequently in TNBC than in non-TNBC cases and was correlated with the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3, which was related to proliferation activity examined with Ki67. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmTOR signaling regulates cell proliferation in some cases of TNBC and may be a potential target of molecular therapy for TNBC. <br>	1022	557	5
Evaluation of Parameters for Cancer-Induced Sarcopenia in Patients Autopsied after Death from Colorectal Cancer.	Cachexia frequently occurs in cancer patients and is correlated with reduced therapeutic responsiveness and poor prognosis. Although skeletal muscle atrophy is an important factor related to cachexia, biomarkers for its early diagnosis are not yet definitive. In this study, weight loss, body mass index, skeletal muscle index (SMI), serum carcinoembryonic antigen, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, serum interleukin (IL)-6, serum high mobility group box (HMGB)-1, and SDS-soluble myosin light chain 1 (SDS-MYL1) of the psoas muscle were examined in 8 autopsied cases of death from colorectal cancer (CRC) as biomarkers of cachexia. SDS-MYL1 was positively correlated to SMI and TNF-α was negatively correlated, but the other factors did not show any correlations with SMI. Multivariate analysis showed that of the 3 cytokines, TNF-α and HMGB1 were correlated with SMI. Furthermore, when the biochemical skeletal muscle maturation marker, SDS-MYL1, was compared with serum cytokines, TNF-α and HMGB1 were negatively correlated but IL-6 was not. In multivariate analysis, only TNF-α was associated with SDS-MYL1. A positive correlation was found between TNF-α and HMGB1. These findings suggest that since TNF-α was inversely correlated with SMI and SDS-MYL1, TNF-α is a serum marker of skeletal muscle atrophy in CRC. Moreover, SDS-MYL1 might be established as a biomarker linked to clinical sarcopenia in experiments in vitro and in vivo. <br>	1234	234	10
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases and the Risk of Cancer: A Cohort Study.	 Observational studies have shown inverse associations between neurological diseases, particularly dementia, and subsequent cancer risk, but is unknown whether this association is valid or arises from bias. We conducted a Danish nationwide cohort study using population-based health registries (1980-2012). The study included patients with dementia (n = 173,434) and with Parkinson's disease (n = 28,835). We followed patients for 10 years to assess subsequent cancer diagnoses. We computed absolute reduction in cancer risk attributable to dementia or Parkinson's disease (expected minus the observed number of cancer cases divided by the person time) and standardized incidence rate ratios (SIRs) as the observed to expected number of cancers, based on sex-, age-, and calendar year-standardized national incidence rates. During 10 years, the reduction in cancer cases were 79.9 per 10,000 person-years for Alzheimer's disease [SIR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.70)], 74.4 per 10,000 person-years for vascular dementia [SIR = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.74)], 55.8 per 10,000 person-years [SIR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.78)] for all-cause dementia, and 4.0 per 10,000 person-years [SIR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.02) for Parkinson's disease. Associations were nearly similar for solid tumors diagnosed at localized, regional, or distant stages. We found an inverse association between dementia and cancer risk, with similar associations when considering only cancers diagnosed at distant stage. The cancer risk varied by type of dementia, with a gradient toward a stronger protective effect associated with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, which may favor a biological explanation. Overall results do not show an inverse association between Parkinson's disease and cancer. <br>	1513	291	10
Glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1) variants and breast cancer risk in Burkina Faso.	Background and objective Breast cancer remains the most common cause of cancer mortality in women. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between genetic variability in GSTM1 and GSTT1 and susceptibility to breast cancer. Methods Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples for 80 cases of histologically diagnosed breast cancer and 100 control subjects. Genotyping analyses were performed by PCR-based methods. Associations between specific genotypes and the development of breast cancer were examined using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios [1] and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results No correlation was found between GSTM1-null and breast cancer (OR = 1.83; 95%CI 0.90-3.71; p = 0.10), while GSTT1-null (OR = 2.42; 95%CI 1.17-5.02; p= 0.01) was associated with increased breast cancer risk. The GSTM1/GSTT1 double null was not associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer (OR = 2.52; 95%CI 0.75-8.45; p = 0.20). Furthermore, analysis found no association between GSTM1-null (OR =1.12; 95%CI 0.08-15.50; p = 1.00) or GSTT1-null (OR = 1.71; 95%CI 0.13-22.51; p = 1.00) and the disease stage of familial breast cancer patients or sporadic breast cancer patients (GSTM1 (OR = 0.40; 95%CI 0.12-1.32; p = 0.20) and GSTT1 (OR = 1.41; 95%CI 0.39-5.12; p = 0.75)). Also, body mass index (BMI) was not associated with increased or decreased breast cancer risk in either GSTM1-null (OR = 0.60; 95%CI 0.21-1.68; p = 0.44) or GSTT1-null (OR = 0.60; 95%CI 0.21-1.68; p =0.45). Conclusion Our results suggest that only GSTT1-null is associated with increased susceptibility to breast cancer development. <br>	1394	304	10
Small molecule STAT3 inhibitor, 6Br-6a suppresses breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.	Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein frequently overexpressed in many malignancies and plays an essential role in regulating proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in cancer cells. However, No STAT3 inhibitor was used clinically. In this study, we evaluated the toxic potential of a novel STAT3 inhibitor, 6Br-6a in breast cancer cell lines. The anti-cancer effect and underlying mechanism of 6Br-6a on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were determined in vitro and in xenograft mouse model. Our data demonstrated that 6Br-6a significantly induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in breast cancer via blocking the activation of STAT3. Finally, we verified these inhibitory effects of 6Br-6a in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, 6Br-6a effectively inhibited activation of STAT3 and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via regulating cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 expression. All of these data indicate that 6Br-6a could be a potential candidate for the treatment of breast cancer. <br>	883	168	8
The regulation and interaction of PVT1 and miR181a-5p contributes to the repression of SP1 expression by the combination of XJD decoction and cisplatin in human lung cancer cells.	The Chinese herbal prescription Xiaoji decoction (XJD) has been used as an adjuvant treatment of cancer for decades. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying XJD enhancement of the efficiency of chemotherapy were undetermined. In this study, we observed that combination of XJD and cisplatin (DDP) showed a greater inhibition on growth and induced a high magnitude of apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We also found that XJD decreased lncRNA PVT1 and increased miR181a-5p expressions. There was a reciprocal interaction between PVT1 and miR181a-5p. XJD decreased SP1 protein, which were overcame by overexpressed PVT1 and inhibitors of miR181a-5p. Overexpressed SP1 reversed the inhibitory effect of XJD on cell growth. Importantly, XJD and DDP exhibited synergy on regulation of PVT1, miR181a-5p, and SP1 expressions. The similar results were observed in one in vivo model. In conclusions, XJD inhibits NSCLC cell growth via reciprocal interaction of PVT1 and miR181a-5p followed by reducing SP1 expression. XJD and DDP exhibit synergy. This study provides a novel mechanism by which XJD enhances the anti-cancer effect of DDP in NSCLC cells. <br>	998	185	12
Protective and anticancer effects of orange peel extract and naringin in doxorubicin treated esophageal cancer stem cell xenograft tumor mouse model.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspchemotherapy drugs are the common therapy for cancer cells with side effects. Recent studies reported that natural products may contribute to decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of orange peel extract (OPE) and its main compound; naringin (NR) to protect the side effects of doxorubicin (Dox) in esophageal cancer stem cells (CSCs) derived tumors in vivo. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfor this purpose, Esophageal cancer cell (YM1) derived spheres were treated in vitro with OPE, NR, Dox, Dox in combination with OPE or NR. The cell viability was assessed by XTT and the apoptosis was measured using Annexin/7-AAD and the cell cycle was also quantified by using PI staining method. The pluripotency related genes expression was carried out using qRT-PCR The protective effects of OPE and NR were evaluated by body weight evaluation and oxidative stress factors: malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) measurement in xenograft mice tumor model injected with Dox. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspESCC CSCs overexpress SOX2 and OCT4 pluripotency genes. OPE or NR can protect the cellular toxicity of Dox in vitro mainly by decreasing cellular apoptosis of ESCC CSCs however S-phase cell cycle arrest has not been affected significantly. In vivo experiments revealed that the use of Dox simultaneously with OPE or NR not only can reduce the tumor size but also the body weight of the treated nude mice were maintained in comparison to Dox alone. In contrast to Dox alone, Dox in combination with OPE or NR showed less systemic toxicity and decreased oxidative stress fraction circulation, however, OPE seemed as more protective. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe results suggest that these natural compounds can be used as adjuvant therapy to lower systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents like DOX in ESCC cancer stem cells treatment. <br>	1562	875	11
Syndecan-2 in colorectal cancer plays oncogenic role via epithelial-mesenchymal transition and MAPK pathway.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this study, we aimed to elucidate the biological roles of Syndecan-2 (SDC2) in colorectal cancer (CRC), thereby further understanding its clinical role. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe expression of SDC2 was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. To understand the potential biological role of SDC2, we also explored the correlation between its expression level and clinicopathologic parameters. By using MTT, plate colony formation assay, Transwell invasion assays, and ﬂow cytometry in vitro, the biological impact of SDC2 on CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. In addition, the related signaling pathways were investigated. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSDC2 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues. The expression of SDC2 was highly associated with four parameters, i.e., stage (P < 0.01), vascular invasion (P = 0.0045), lymph node metastasis (P=0.0018), and distant metastasis (P = 0.0019). Knockdown of SDC2 significantly reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCT116 and SW480 cells, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, SDC2 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC cells, whereas the ratio of p-MEK/MEK and p-ERK/ERK markedly reduced after depleting SDC2. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDuring CRC development, overexpression of SDC2 plays a carcinogenic role in CRC. Therapeutic solutions targeting SDC2 may provide potential insights into CRC prevention and treatment. <br>	1181	582	11
Magnoflorine improves sensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX) of breast cancer cells via inducing apoptosis and autophagy through AKT/mTOR and p38 signaling pathways.	Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a broad-spectrum anti-breast cancer agent, but its clinical use is restricted due to irreversible tissue toxicity. Thereby, new therapeutic approaches are urgently required to promote the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to DOX. Magnoflorine (Mag), a quaternary alkaloid isolated from Chinese herb Magnolia or Aristolochia, has various biological activities, such as anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, and anti-anxiety. In the study, we explored the effects Mag on the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to DOX. We demonstrated that Mag strongly promoted DOX-induced anti-proliferative effects in breast cancer cells while not in normal cells. Mag addition markedly promoted the effects of DOX on the inhibition of migration and invasion in breast cancer cells. DOX-triggered DNA damage in breast cancer cells was further accelerated by combination with Mag. DOX-induced cell distribution in G2/M phase was markedly elevated when co-treated with Mag. Additionally, DOX/Mag combinational treatment significantly induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells when compared to DOX alone group through inducing Caspase-3 cleavage. Moreover, Mag markedly promoted the role of DOX in autophagy induction by elevating light chain 3 (LC3)-II expression. Combination treatment with DOX and Mag significantly inhibited the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling, and promoted p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In addition, treatment with wortmannin (Wor, a blocker of autophagosome formation) markedly reduced DOX/Mag-induced p38 MAPK activation and LC3 conversion in breast cancer cells. Further, in MCF-7 xenograft model, DOX combined with Mag displayed a significant anti-tumor effect with little toxicity to organs such as liver, heart, kidney and spleen. These findings suggested that Mag promoted the anti-cancer effects of DOX to induce cellular apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells. <br>	1791	316	15
Value of serum tumor markers for predicting EGFR mutations and positive ALK expression in 1089 Chinese non-small-cell lung cancer patients: A retrospective analysis.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe role of serum tumor markers (STMs) in the modern management of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations in lung cancer remains poorly described. In this study, we investigated whether STMs could be a valuable noninvasive tool to predict EGFR mutations and ALK positivity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. <br><b>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe retrospectively reviewed and included 1089 NSCLC patients who underwent EGFR or ALK mutation testing and STMs measurement prior to treatment. The differences in several clinical characteristics and STMs between the subgroups were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of EGFR mutations and ALK positivity. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEGFR mutations were found more frequently in females (63.11%), never-smokers (59.69%), and those with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) (53.87%). Negative carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125, ferritin (FERR), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), and soluble fragment of cytokeratin 19 (CYFRA 21-1) levels were significantly associated with EGFR mutations (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ADC, never-smoker status, and negative CA 125 and SCC results were predictors of EGFR mutations (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.715 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.673-0.758) for the combination of the four factors. Positive ALK expression was found more frequently in younger patients (median age: 49 years), females (8.40%), never-smokers (8.82%), and those negative for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (8.02%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that younger age and never-smoker status were the only independent predictors of ALK positivity (p < 0.05). The ROC curve yielded an AUC of 0.760 (95% CI: 0.677-0.844) for the combination of these two factors. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSTMs are associated with mutant EGFR status and could be integrated with other clinical factors to enhance the ability to distinguish EGFR mutation status among NSCLC patients. For ALK-positive patients, younger age and never-smoker status could predict the mutation status, whereas STMs could not. <br>	1850	868	14
Modified gemcitabine and oxaliplatin or gemcitabine + cisplatin in unresectable gallbladder cancer: Results of a phase III randomised controlled trial.	<b>AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo determine equivalence of modified gemcitabine and oxaliplatin compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin in unresectable gallbladder cancer (GBC). Primary end-point was overall survival (OS). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOpen label, prospective, randomised phase III equivalence study. Inclusion criteria included histologically proven unresectable GBC, 18 years or older, adequate organ functions and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ≤2. <br><b>SAMPLE SIZE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp108 patients were required in each arm to have an equivalence margin of ±2 months with power of 80%. <br><b>TREATMENT:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspModified gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (mGemOx)-gemcitabine 900 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 80 mg/m2, maximum 6 cycles; gemcitabine + cisplatin (CisGem)-gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, cisplatin 25 mg/m2, maximum 8 cycles, all day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwo hundred sixty subjects were recruited between February 2011 and July 2015. Two hundred forty-three patients (119, mGemOx and 124, CisGem) received at least 1 dose and analysed for safety and efficacy (modified intention to treat). Median OS was 8·5 months for whole group (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7·9-9·1). Median OS in mGemOx was 9 months and 8·3 months in CisGem; p = 0·057 (hazard ratio = 0·78; 95% CI = 0·60-1·02). Restricted mean OS for follow-up limited to 30 months was 11·2 months (95% CI: 9·8-12·6) in mGemOx and 10·4 months (95% CI: 9·1-11·7) in CisGem. Difference of the mean was 0·8 months with 95% CI, exceeding 2 months (-1·1 to 2·7), hence rejecting equivalence. Peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytopaenia in mGemOx and nephrotoxicity was higher with CisGem. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis trial failed to show equivalence of eight cycles of CisGem to six cycles of mGemOx. Numerically OS was better with mGemOx. Toxicities were different. The trial was not powered to answer superiority. <br><b>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCTRI/2010/091/001406. <br>	1498	1339	16
Rab8 GTPase regulates Klotho-mediated inhibition of cell growth and progression by directly modulating its surface expression in human non-small cell lung cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe klotho (KL) gene is an anti-aging gene that has recently been shown to also function as a general tumor suppressor. However, there is currently only limited information regarding the potential molecular signals for regulation of Klotho without identifying precise molecular mechanisms or interactions. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe performed a mass spectrometry (MS) assay to screen candidate proteins complexed with Klotho derived from immunoprecipitation in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and identified Rab8 to be the protein that most prominently interacts with Klotho. We further investigated whether Rab8 can regulate trafficking of Klotho and which process it would modulate using surface biotinylation assay, immunofluorescence and fluorescence ratio microscopy. Furthermore, we explored whether Rab8 is involved in Klotho-mediated function in NSCLC, and verified the results which we found in vivo using xenograft mouse model. <br><b>FINDINGS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe report discovery of Rab8 as a Klotho-interacting protein that acts as a critical modulator of Klotho surface expression in human NSCLC. In particular, we report that Rab8 is co-localized and associated with Klotho, and Klotho trafficking is regulated by Rab8. Moreover, we found that Rab8 modulates surface levels of Klotho via a post-biosynthetic pathway, as opposed to an endocytic pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Rab8 is involved in Klotho-mediated regulation of cell proliferation, migration, invasiveness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and Wnt-β-catenin signaling in NSCLC. Additionally, Rab8 overexpression was also found to increase Klotho-mediated inhibition of NSCLC tumorigenesis in vivo. <br><b>INTERPRETATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOverall, our findings suggest that Rab8 GTPase can regulate Klotho-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling activity by modulating translocation of Klotho onto the cell surface, which in turn affects Klotho-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness in NSCLC. These results have important implications for the development of new therapeutic targets, Klotho-related research in the context of NSCLC as well as other areas, and provide a working model for Rab8 function in the context of cancer and cancer biology. <br>	1884	829	12
Fear of progression and its role in the relationship of cancer-related fatigue with physical functioning and global quality of life - A register-based study among hematological cancer survivors.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFear of progression (FoP) is a frequent symptom among cancer patients, but data among hematological cancer survivors are scarce. Furthermore, theory assumes that FoP serves as link between bodily symptoms and different aspects of quality of life. However, this model has not been tested with the bodily symptom cancer-related fatigue (CRF) so far. Therefore, we investigated (i) levels of FoP stratified by type of and time since diagnosis and (ii) whether FoP mediates relationships of CRF with physical functioning (PF) and global quality of life (QoL). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis cross-sectional study recruited long-term survivors of hematological malignancies (mean time since diagnosis: 9 years) via two regional cancer registries. We applied analyses of (co-)variance and mediation analyses to identify indirect effects. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp922 survivors participated. There was no overall effect of type of diagnosis on FoP (Fconditional = 1.6, p = .15). However, we found an overall effect of time since diagnosis on FoP (Fconditional = 8.5, p < .001), with FoP being significantly elevated in the group closest to diagnosis. As hypothesized, we found an indirect (mediating) effect of FoP in the associations of CRF with QoL (β = -0.13, 97.5 %-CI = [-0.17; -0.09]) and PF (β = -0.12, 97.5 %-CI = [-0.17; -0.08]). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAmong long-term survivors of hematological malignancies, a shorter time since diagnosis seems to be associated with elevated levels of FoP. Addressing FoP in psycho-oncological interventions may help to buffer the detrimental effects of CRF. However, longitudinal data is needed to validate our findings. <br>	1345	754	13
Long-term patient-reported outcomes after high-dose chemoradiotherapy for non-surgical management of distal rectal cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSurgery is standard treatment for rectal cancer, but neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) may result in clinical complete response (cCR) in select patients, allowing for non-surgical management (NSM). Prospective studies of NSM strategies are sparse however, and long-term data on quality of life (QoL) are limited. We conducted a single-arm phase II trial of high-dose CRT for NSM of distal rectal cancer; we report secondary long-term patient-reported outcomes (PROs), local regrowth and overall survival (OS) in patients managed non-surgically. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFifty-one patients with resectable, T2 or T3, N0-N1, low adenocarcinoma received 65Gy (IMRT, brachytherapy boost) and oral tegafur-uracil. Patients with cCR 6 weeks after treatment (clinical examination, MRI, biopsy) were referred for observation, and followed closely with clinical examinations, endoscopies, PET-CTs, and PROs for 5 years. Overall colorectal cancer specific QoL and specific symptom scores were evaluated at baseline and in follow up, and compared between timepoints. Local regrowth was estimated using cumulative incidence; overall survival using Kaplan-Meier estimates. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspForty patients achieved cCR after treatment; 29 were in follow-up at 24m, 21 at 36m, 20 at 60m. PRO questionnaire completion rates were 90% at 24 months, 100% at 36m, and 85% at 60m, respectively, for patients still in follow-up. Average QoL score did not differ between baseline (median 11.1) and 24m (13.7), 48m (11.1,) or 60m (6.9). Only rectal bleeding deteriorated from baseline, with bowel and bladder related symptom scores otherwise unchanged in follow-up. At median follow-up of 5.0 years, local regrowth rate and OS were 31% (95 CI 15%-47%) and 85% (95 CI 75%-97%), respectively. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLong term follow-up after NSM of distal rectal cancer showed excellent general colorectal cancer QoL and local symptom scores. Our study results indicate that high dose CRT followed by organ preservation might be an alternative to standard treatment. <br>	1691	927	14
At a Glance: A History of Autophagy and Cancer.	Since the first discovery of the lysosome and the definition of autophagy by Christian de Duve more than 60 years ago, research on autophagy, a process targeting cytoplasmic materials for lysosomal degradation and recycling, has expanded dramatically. This research has extended our understanding of the basic mechanism of autophagy as well as its role in pathophysiology. Autophagy deficiency has been reported to be involved in numerous diseases, among which cancer has been extensively studied, in part because autophagy appears to play a dual role, depending on the stage of tumorigenesis. In this review, we will briefly revisit the intriguing history of autophagy and cancer, underscoring the importance of harnessing this pathway for the benefit of human health. <br>	658	119	4
Under-prescription of Step III opioids in French cancer survivors with chronic pain: a call for integrated early palliative care in oncology.	<b>CONTEXT:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChronic pain (CP) is a major concern in cancer survivors. Often underreported by patients, it is both under-assessed and undertreated by care providers. <br><b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo assess CP prevalence and related treatment in cancer survivors five years after diagnosis; to identify factors associated with prescribing opioids among survivors with CP, focusing on access to palliative care (PC). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn 2015-2016, we interviewed 4,174 French patients diagnosed with cancer five years previously. Combining patient and clinical reported outcomes together with medico-administrative data, we studied factors associated with Step II and Step III opioid prescription in cancer survivors with CP. We performed multinomial logistic regression adjusting for various covariates, including self-reported health status variables and inpatient PC. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFive years after cancer diagnosis, 63.5% of the respondents reported current chronic pain (CP) (i.e., pain ≥ 3 months). Of these, 64.6% and 14.4% were prescribed at least one Step II or Step III opioid, respectively. Only 1.9% had had inpatient PC since diagnosis. After adjustment for age, gender, clinical and self-reported variables, we found that the latter were more likely to receive Step III opioids (adjusted Relative Risk ratio: 5.33; 95% CI: 1.15, 24.58). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study showed a high prevalence of CP five years after cancer diagnosis. Step III opioids were underprescribed but positively associated with inpatient PC. PC access in France remains limited, especially among cancer survivors. Integrating PC in oncology is essential to provide the best cancer-related symptoms management. <br>	1374	770	14
Structures of SF3b1 reveal a dynamic Achilles heel of spliceosome assembly: Implications for cancer-associated abnormalities and drug discovery.	The pre-mRNA splicing factor SF3b1 exhibits recurrent mutations among hematologic malignancies and cancers, and consequently is a major therapeutic target of clinically-advanced spliceosome inhibitors. In this review, we highlight and rigorously analyze emerging views of SF3b1 conformational transitions, including the human SF3b particle either in isolation or bound to spliceosome inhibitors, and human or yeast spliceosome assemblies. Among spliceosome states characterized to date, an SF3b1 α-helical superhelix significantly closes to surround a U2 small nuclear RNA duplex with the pre-mRNA branch point sequence. The SF3b1 torus is locally unwound at an active site adenosine, whereas protein cofactors appear to stabilize overall closure in the spliceosome. Network analyses demonstrates that the natural SF3b1 dynamics mimic its conformational change in the spliceosome, raising the possibility of conformational selection underpinning spliceosome assembly. These dynamic SF3b1 conformations have consequences for gatekeeping of spliceosome assembly and therapeutic targeting of its cancer-associated dysfunction. <br>	982	154	6
Tumor treating fields cause replication stress and interfere with DNA replication fork maintenance: Implications for cancer therapy.	Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a noninvasive physical modality of cancer therapy that applies low-intensity, intermediate frequency, and alternating electric fields to a tumor. Interference with mitosis was the first mechanism describing the effects of TTFields on cancer cells; however, TTFields was shown to not only reduce the rejoining of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), but to also induce DNA DSBs. The mechanism(s) by which TTFields generates DNA DSBs is related to the generation of replication stress including reduced expression of the DNA replication complex genes MCM6 and MCM10 and the Fanconi's Anemia pathway genes. When markers of DNA replication stress as a result of TTFields exposure were examined, newly replicated DNA length was reduced with TTFields exposure time and there was increased R-loop formation. Furthermore, as cells were exposed to TTFields a conditional vulnerability environment developed which rendered cells more susceptible to DNA damaging agents or agents that interfere with DNA repair or replication fork maintenance. The effect of TTFields exposure with concomitant exposure to cisplatin or PARP inhibition, the combination of TTFields plus concomitant PARP inhibition followed by radiation, or radiation alone at the end of a TTFields exposure were all synergistic. Finally, gene expression analysis of 47 key mitosis regulator genes suggested that TTFields-induced mitotic aberrations and DNA damage/replication stress events, although intimately linked to one another, are likely initiated independently of one another. This suggests that enhanced replication stress and reduced DNA repair capacity are also major mechanisms of TTFields effects, effects for which there are therapeutic implications. <br>	1522	262	8
The intricate relationship between diabetes, obesity and pancreatic cancer.	Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading determinants of global cancer mortality, and its incidence is predicted to increase, to become in 2030 the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Obesity and diabetes are recognized risk factors for the development of pancreatic cancer. In the last few decades an epidemic of diabetes and obesity has been spreading worldwide, forewarning an increase in incidence of pancreatic cancer. This review considers the most recent literature, covering the multiple molecular axis linking these three pathologies, aiming to draw a more comprehensive view of pancreatic cancer for a better theragnostic stratification of the population. <br>	583	104	4
The role of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer.	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as prominent regulators of gene expression are involved in different layers of expression regulation. These transcripts participate in carcinogenesis of several human malignancies including thyroid cancer. Availability of high throughput techniques such as RNA sequencing and microarray has facilitated identification of lncRNAs whose dysregulation affect tumorigenesis process. Moreover, assessment of differentially expressed lncRNAs between resistant and sensitive cells has led to recognition of biomarkers for therapeutic response. One elucidated aspect of lncRNAs functions is their role in sponging miRNAs. Several miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA triplets have been recognized till now. Any of these triplets is a putative target of interfering with the evolution of cancer. In the current study, we have summarized recent data in the fields of biology of lncRNAs, their role in thyroid cancer and their potential as biomarker or treatment target. <br>	841	139	8
Analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-directed Biopsy Strategies for Changing the Paradigm of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe use of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-directed diagnostic pathway in men at first prostate cancer work-up has been introduced within European prostate cancer guidelines. Differences in MRI-directed pathway yields need elaboration. <br><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo investigate the diagnostic yields of MRI-directed diagnostic pathways in biopsy-naïve men suspected of having prostate cancer. <br><b>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis analysis uses the data of the Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy systematic review on the utility of prostate MRI and MRI-targeted biopsy for significant disease in men at first diagnosis. The paired agreement analysis data were reformulated for five unique biopsy strategies focusing on diagnostic yields and biopsy avoidance. <br><b>OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSignificant prostate cancer was defined as International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group ≥2. <br><b>RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe detection-focused pathway maximises the detection of significant disease (28% [95% confidence interval {CI} 24-34%]), while not reducing biopsy or core numbers, or the overdiagnoses of insignificant cancers (21% [18-25%]). The triage-focused pathway omits systematic biopsy use (reduction of 100%) and thereby reduces overdiagnoses of ISUP grade group 1 cancers (to 14% [11-17%]), but compromises the detection of significant disease (23% [19-28%]). The MRI-focused pathway maximises the detection of significant disease in MRI-positive men at a cost of nondetection of significant disease in MRI-negative men, thus reducing biopsies and overdiagnoses of ISUP grade 1 (strategy proposed by European Association of Urology guidelines). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll MRI-directed biopsy pathways have beneficial outcomes compared with conventional systematic biopsy, with potentially reduced risks and harms. MRI-directed biopsy management as the default strategy optimises diagnostic yields in men at first diagnosis and may be the only test required in a significant proportion. Deploying additional systematic biopsy depends on balancing risks and benefits according to clinical care priorities. <br><b>PATIENT SUMMARY:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHigh-quality data on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based prostate cancer diagnosis suggests that MRI-directed pathways are better than standard systematic biopsies in making correct diagnoses of important prostate cancers in men presenting for the first time with suspected cancer. MRI-directed diagnostics should be backed up by a systematic biopsy in selected men, according to MRI findings and patient risk profiles. <br>	2085	1456	14
Expanding the indication of endoscopic submucosal dissection for undifferentiated early gastric cancer is safe or not?	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEndoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has gained more popularity in the treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC). Although there is a lack of confirmed evidence for the feasibility of ESD for undifferentiated EGC. The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of ESD with expanded indications for undifferentiated EGC patients. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspData from patients with undifferentiated EGC (including signet-ring cell carcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, mixed adenocarcinoma, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma) who underwent radical surgical resection were retrospectively reviewed. The relationship between the clinical parameters and the incidence of lymph node metastasis (LNM) was investigated. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 517 patients were included in this study. The results showed that LNM was significantly associated with ulceration, tumor size, depth of invasion, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, and perineural invasion. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that tumor size (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03-2.52, P = 0.0367), depth of tumor invasion (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.66-4.63, P = 0.0001), and lymphatic invasion (OR = 14.74, 95% CI = 1.58-137.36, P = 0.0182) were independent risk factors for LNM. In the patients who would be included under the new proposed guidelines for ESD, including men with mucosal tumors ≤2 cm and without ulceration or lymphatic or venous infiltration, LNM was present in 11.9% (14/118). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCaution to be exercised in expanding application of ESD should be carefully weighed in undifferentiated EGC. <br>	1321	687	10
[Breast cancer epidemiology].	The breast is the leading cancer site in women throughout the world. That said, breast cancer incidence varies widely, ranging from 27/100,0002 (Central-East Asia and Africa) to 85-94/100,0002 (Australia, North America and Western Europe). Its frequency in France is among the highest in Europe. While in most countries, its incidence has been increasing for more than 40 years, in a few other countries (USA, Canada, Australia, France…), it has been decreasing since 2000-2005. Possibly due to a substantial reduction of hormone-based treatments at menopause, the decrease may be transient. It is also the leading cause of female cancer deaths in almost all countries, with the exception of the most economically developed, in which it is currently second to lung cancer. That much said, for thirty years in highly industrialized countries such as France, breast cancer mortality has been declining. Taken together, early diagnosis and improved treatment explain this success. In France, 5-year survival and 10-year survival approximate 88 % and 78 % respectively; these rates are among the most elevated in Western Europe. Excess mortality due to breast cancer is consequently low (<5 %) but variable according to age, and maximal during the first two years of follow-up. Several thousand epidemiological studies on risk factors for breast cancer have been carried out worldwide; it is difficult to draw up an overall assessment, especially insofar as the identified factors interact and vary according to whether the cancers occur before or after menopause and depending on their histological, biological (receptors) or molecular characteristics. Moreover, their prevalence varies in time and from one region to another. For the majority of these factors, the level of relative risk is≤2. Genetic particularities: presence of proliferative mastopathy, a first child after 35 years of age and thoracic irradiation are the sole factors entailing relative risk from 2 to 5 (comparatively speaking, the risk levels associated with tobacco consumption reach values from 10 to 20, and in some cases even higher). However, exposure to risk factors≤2 may be relatively frequent and consequently favorable to development of a substantial number of breast cancers. Estimation (based on degree of risk and frequency of exposure) of the proportion of risk attributable to a given factor facilitates decision-making aimed at determining the most effective primary prevention actions. Taking into consideration the identified factors pertaining to post-menopausal cancers, only 35 % [23 to 45 %] of the attributable proportions could be reduced by primary prevention. In view of achieving this level of reduction, it is possible to put forward the following recommendations: for the women themselves: have a first child before the age of 30, breastfeed for several months, engage in sufficiently intense and regular physical activity, avoid or reduce excess weight after turning thirty, avoid exposure to active or passive smoking, limit alcohol consumption; for their physicians: do not prescribe pointless thoracic irradiations (unnecessary mammography in particular) or unjustified hormonal treatments. *persons/years. <br>	2735	494	18
[What attitude to women at high risk of breast cancer?]	In France, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer deaths. Identifying women with a "high" or "very high" breast cancer risk, according the terminology of the Haute Autorité de Santé 2014 guidelines, is essential to offer them special cares in term of screening and prevention. Women genetically predisposed have a very high risk of breast cancer. During the oncogenetic specialist consultation, familial and personal history of cancer is taken into account to evaluate the risk of hereditary Breast/Ovarian syndrome and thus the need of a genetic screening. In 2017, a list of 13 genes involved in hereditary ovarian or breast cancer has been established in France (Genetic and Cancer Group - Unicancer). Women carrying a BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, TP53, CDH1, PTEN mutation have a higher risk of breast cancer and are considered as "high risk". Therefore, medical breast surveillance similar to carriers of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation is recommended for these patients (INCa guidelines 2017). However a mutation in one of those genes is only identified in approximatively 10 % of the screened families. The oncogenetic specialist's assessment distinguishes families in which women remain at a "high" risk of breast cancer (HAS 2014 for screening) from those where women have a "very high" risk (INCa guidelines 2017 for screening and prevention). <br>	1168	220	9
CNT-based nanocarrier loaded with pyrimethamine for adipose mesenchymal stem cells differentiation and cancer treatment: The computational and experimental methods.	Pyrimethamine is an effective drug in the cancer cell treatment and is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor. In this work, the amount of drug loading up on CNT and its cytotoxicity effect upon MCF-7 cell lines was surveyed. The novel applications of some drugs and nanocarriers can induce the differentiation of adipose mesenchymal cells into nerve cells. Hence carbon nanotube-pyrimethamine was used to differentiate mesenchymal stem cells into the neural category, for the first time. The results of NSE and NFM gene expression level were evaluated using the real-time PCR. A detailed study on the interaction between pyrimethamine anticancer drug and (6, 0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotube was performed by DFT/B3LYP and DFT/M06-2X with 6-31G* basis set calculations in gas phase and in solvent using the PCM. Different configurations of the adsorbed pyrimethamine onto the CNT surface were studied. Based on the results, the process of pyrimethamine adsorption on diﬀerent sites on the outer wall of the nanotube was exothermic and configurations were stable. The adsorption energy values indicated that the pyrimethamine molecule could be physically adsorbed on the external surface of the SWCNT. The QTAIM was used for characterizing the nature of the interactions between the pyrimethamine and the selected nanocarrier. <br>	1135	211	10

Calcium signaling affects migration and proliferation differently in individual cancer cells due to nifedipine treatment.	Several papers have reported that calcium channel blocking drugs were associated with increased breast cancer risk and worsened prognosis. One of the most common signs of breast tumors is the presence of small deposits of calcium, known as microcalcifications. Therefore, we studied the effect of dihydropyridine nifedipine on selected calcium transport systems in MDA-MB-231 cells, originating from triple negative breast tumor and JIMT1 cells that represent a model of HER2-positive breast cancer, which possesses amplification of HER2 receptor, but cells do not response to HER2 inhibition treatment with trastuzumab. Also, we compared the effect of nifedipine on colorectal DLD1 and ovarian A2780 cancer cells. Both, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1) and type 1 sodium calcium exchanger (NCX1) were upregulated due to nifedipine in DLD1 and A2780 cells, but not in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and JIMT1 cells. On contrary to MDA-MB-231 and JIMT1 cells, in DLD1 and A2780 cells nifedipine induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. After NCX1 silencing and subsequent treatment with nifedipine, proliferation was decreased in MDA-MB-231, increased in DLD1 cells, and not changed in JIMT1 cells. Silencing of IP3R1 revealed increase in proliferation in DLD1 and JIMT1 cells, but caused decrease in proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cell line after nifedipine treatment. Interestingly, after nifedipine treatment migration was not significantly affected in any of tested cell lines after NCX1 silencing. Due to IP3R1 silencing, significant decrease in migration occurred in MDA-MB-231 cells after nifedipine treatment, but not in other tested cells. These results support different function of the NCX1 and IP3R1 in the invasiveness of various cancer cells due to nifedipine treatment. <br>	1551	282	11
In-hospital 30-day mortality for older patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSurgical resection remains the only potentially curative therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). There is paucity of literature about morbidity and mortality in older patients with PDAC undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. This retrospective analysis evaluates the in-hospital 30-day mortality of this population utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. <br><b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll US patients hospitalized for pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) were included. Data was obtained from the NIS provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Pancreaticoduodenectomy diagnoses were identified using Clinical Classifications Software codes based on ICD-9 between 2007 and 2010. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using the logistic model, weighted chi-square test, and generalized linear model. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 6149 patient discharges for pancreaticoduodenectomy were identified. Mean age was 64.9 years (SD ± 12.3); 21% of patients were ≥ 76 years of age. Majority were White (N = 5257, 77.9%) with a male:female ratio of 1. Patients aged 76 and older (OR: 1.76; 1.36-2.28; p < .001), Hispanics (OR: 1.40; 0.92-2.13; p = .12), and high comorbidity score (OR: 5.70; 3.44-9.46; p < .001) were found to be associated with a higher risk of 30-day in-hospital mortality. In the multivariable analysis, advanced age (>76) remained a significant predictor of longer in-hospital length of stay (OR: 1.09; 1.04-1.14; p < .001) and 30-day in-hospital mortality (OR 1.46; 1.07-2.00; p = .016). The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate for all patients across all years was 3.24%, for patients >76 years 4.11% and for patients <76 years 2.77%. Patients who underwent surgery at teaching hospitals (OR: 0.61; 0.42-0.88; p = .008) had a lower risk of 30-day in-hospital mortality compared to non-teaching hospitals. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn-hospital 30 day mortality was higher in selected older patients with PDAC undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Mortality was lower at high volume and teaching centers. Further stringent selection criteria are needed to decrease mortality in the older population. <br>	1801	893	16
Benefits of minimally-invasive surgery for sigmoid and rectal cancer in older adults compared with younger adults: Do older adults have the most to gain?	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRandomized trials demonstrated oncologic safety and short-term benefits of laparoscopy. We investigated if the benefit of laparoscopy on short-term outcomes is greater for older adults compared with younger adults. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe identified all older (≥70 years old) and younger (<70) adults with primary sigmoid and rectal cancer treated with resection between 2002 and 2018 from an institutional database. We compared 30-day postoperative outcomes using multivariable logistic regression with an interaction term between age group and surgical approach. Primary outcomes were death, major (Clavien-Dindo III-IV) and minor (Clavien-Dindo I-II) complications, and wound complications. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe included 792 patients, 293 (37%) older and 499 (63%) younger. Use of laparoscopy was similar between age groups: 120/293 (41%) older, 204/499 (41%) younger (p = .98). All patients had 30-day follow-up. Compared with open resection, minimally-invasive resection was associated with a greater reduction in deaths in older adults than in younger adults (absolute difference in older adults 7.0% less versus 2.1% less in younger adults; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] older 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-7.33; aOR younger 0.31, 95% CI 0.05-1.24; interaction p = .01). Similarly, minimally-invasive resection was associated with a greater reduction in major complications in older adults than in younger adults (absolute difference in older adults 6.4% less versus 2.4% less in younger adults; aOR older 1.91, 95% CI 1.07-3.41; aOR younger 0.70, 95% CI 0.34-1.38; interaction p = .03). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMinimally-invasive compared with open surgery demonstrated a differential benefit on postoperative death and major complications between younger and older adults. <br>	1482	748	11
Development of a predictor of one-year mortality in older patients with cancer by geriatric and oncologic parameters.	<b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMore than 60% of the new cancer diagnoses are currently made in older adults, a highly heterogeneous population. Reliable and time-saving tools to define older adults' prognosis are needed to inform the oncologist's decisions in routine clinical practice. We sought to define a multi-domain classification tool for the prediction of all-cause one-year mortality in a cohort of older adults with solid tumors. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe conducted a single-centre, prospective study of patients with solid cancer aged 65 or older and with G8 score ≤ 14. All patients underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) before starting their surgical or medical treatment. One-year mortality was recorded. A CGA-based prediction tool of one-year mortality was developed and subsequently validated in two independent training and testing cohorts with a 70/30 split, respectively. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp162 patients were enrolled. Mean patient age was 78 ± 5.5 years. Forty-three percent of the patients were men. Colorectal and breast cancer were the most common diagnoses. The clinical variables selected for the development of the new classifier (MetaGENUA®) were: mini-nutritional assessment (MNA), instrumental day life activities (IADL), Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), geriatric depression scale (GDS), age, and cancer stage. In our independent validation cohort, MetaGENUA® showed high specificity (0.86) and AUC = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.55-0.87). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMetaGENUA® predicts one-year mortality in older patients with cancer with high specificity. As such, MetaGENUA® is predicted to reveal as a useful tool to guide the oncologist's decisions in clinical practice. <br>	1385	765	14
Diabetes mellitus is associated with unfavorable pathologic features, increased postoperative mortality, and worse long-term survival in resected pancreatic cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly in those with new-onset DM. However, the impact of DM on outcomes following pancreatic surgery is not fully understood. We sought to explore the effects of DM on post-resection outcomes in patients undergoing either upfront resection or following neoadjuvant treatment (NAT). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspResections for PDAC between 2007 and 2016 were identified from a prospectively-maintained database. Data on demographics, pathology, and perioperative outcomes were compared between patients with or without DM. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted for confounders by a Cox-proportional hazards model. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp662 patients were identified, of whom 277 (41.8%) had DM. Diabetics were more likely to be male, had higher BMI, and higher ASA-scores. At pathology, DM was associated with larger tumors (30 vs. 26 mm; p = 0.041), higher rates of lymph-node involvement (69% vs. 59%; p = 0.031) and perineural invasion (88% vs. 82%; p = 0.026). Despite having similar rates of complications, diabetics experienced higher 30-day mortality (3.2% vs. 0.8%; p = 0.019). Median overall survival was worse in diabetic patients (18 vs. 34 months; p < 0.001); this effect was more pronounced in patients with NAT (18 vs. 54 months; p < 0.001). At multivariate analysis, DM was confirmed as an independent predictor of post-resection survival. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDM is a common comorbidity in PDAC and is associated with unfavorable pathology, as well as worse postoperative and oncologic outcomes. The blunted effect on survival is more pronounced in patients who undergo resection following NAT. <br>	1431	749	20
Unusual intraoral cancer with unexpected outcome in a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum: an alert for antineoplastic treatment.	Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation. DNA repair mechanisms are impaired, and minimal sun exposure can lead to the development of cutaneous neoplasms in very young patients. Intraoral carcinomas are uncommon and, when present, are located mainly at the tongue tip. We report an unprecedented case of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the floor of mouth of a 23-year-old woman with XP. The patient was referred to the oncologist, and 2 months after surgical resection, she underwent a single session of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. However, she died 73 hours after undergoing her first chemotherapy session. Considering the unexpected outcome of this case, we also investigated possible exacerbated adverse effects of antineoplastic treatments (especially cisplatin-based chemotherapy) in patients with XP and reviewed the main characteristics of the disease, especially cases with oral manifestations reported in the literature. <br>	872	150	7
Quasi-ultrafine particles promote cell metastasis via HMGB1-mediated cancer cell adhesion.	With increasingly severe air pollution, the aggravated health risks of particulate matter, especially ultrafine particles, are emerging as an urgent and sensitive topic. Considering the heterogeneity and complexity of ultrafine particles, there is insufficient evidence about their toxic effects and possible molecular mechanisms. To address this question, we analyzed the emission characteristics of quasi-ultrafine particles collected during winter in a typical coal-burning city, Taiyuan, and confirmed their contribution to lung cancer cell adhesion and metastasis. For the specific mechanism, we revealed that the endocytosis of quasi-ultrafine particles stimulated the release of HMGB1, induced NFκB-facilitated proinflammatory cytokine production through the interaction of HMGB1 with RAGE, and resulted in cancer-endothelial cell adhesion. These findings remind us of the potential effects of anthropogenic quasi-ultrafine particle pollution and provide a theoretical reference for the mitigation of tumorigenesis in a severe particulate matter contaminated environment. <br>	944	148	5
Effectiveness and normal tissue toxicity of Auger electron (AE) radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab in mice with triple-negative or trastuzumab-resistant human breast cancer xenografts that overexpress EGFR.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and normal tissue toxicity of nimotuzumab labeled with the Auger electron (AE)-emitter, 111In ([111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab) for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive BC tumors overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) in athymic mice. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNormal tissue toxicity was studied in non-tumor-bearing Balb/c mice i.v. administered 9.0 or 28.6 MBq (3 mg/kg) of [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab, unlabeled nimotuzumab (3 mg/kg) or normal saline. A complete blood cell count (CBC) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (Cr) were measured at 14 days. Body weight was monitored. RIT studies were performed in CD-1 athymic mice engrafted s.c. with MDA-MB-468 human TNBC tumors or TrR1 HER2-positive but trastuzumab-resistant BC tumors. Mice were i.v. administered two amounts (15.5 MBq; 3 mg/kg) of [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab separated by 14 days. Control mice received unlabeled Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab (3 mg/kg) or anti-HER2 [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-trastuzumab or normal saline. Tumor growth and body weight were measured for 6 weeks. A tumor growth index (TGI) and body weight index (BWI) were calculated to compare the tumor size and body weight post-treatment with the pre-treatment values. A tumor doubling ratio (TDR) was calculated for each treatment group compared to control mice receiving normal saline. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere was no loss of body weight or decreased red blood cells (RBC) or platelets (PLT) or increased serum ALT or Cr in Balb/c mice administered 9.0 or 28.6 MBq (3 mg/kg) of [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab compared to mice treated with unlabeled Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab (3 mg/kg) or normal saline. There was a significant decrease in white blood cell (WBC) counts in Balb/c mice receiving 28.6 MBq but not 9.0 MBq of [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab. Based on these results, an administered amount of 15.5 MBq (3 mg/kg) was selected for RIT studies. Administration of two amounts (15.5 MBq; 3 mg/kg) separated by 14 days to CD-1 athymic mice with s.c. MDA-MB-468 xenografts strongly inhibited tumor growth. The TDR for mice treated with [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab was 2.15 compared to control mice receiving normal saline. In contrast, treatment with unlabeled Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab or [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-trastuzumab had no significant effect on tumor growth (TDR = 0.96 and 1.08, respectively). RIT with [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab also strongly inhibited the growth of TrR1 tumors in athymic mice (TDR = 2.13) compared to unlabeled Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab (TDR = 0.91). There were no losses in body weight over 6 weeks in tumor bearing mice receiving [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab, unlabeled Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab, [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-trastuzumab or normal saline. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab was effective for treatment of TNBC or trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive human BC tumors in mice that overexpress EGFR at administered amounts that caused no decrease in body weight or normal tissue toxicity in non-tumor-bearing Balb/c mice. <br><b>ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur results suggest that Auger electron RIT with [111In]In-Bn-DTPA-nimotuzumab may provide a novel therapeutic option for patients with TNBC or trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive BC that overexpresses EGFR. The low normal tissue toxicity of this approach may allow combination with other targeted therapies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). <br>	2950	2030	21
Multigene assays in early breast cancer: Insights from recent phase 3 studies.	Multigene assays (MGAs) guide treatment in early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) enabling selective and effective use of adjuvant chemotherapy (CT). Support for all MGAs had previously been derived from retrospectively-analyzed, prospective studies. Only 2 ESBC MGAs, the 70-gene signature (MammaPrint®) and the 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) assay (Oncotype DX®), are now supported by entirely prospective randomized phase 3 trials. These studies varied in their primary objectives, design, and eligibility. The MINDACT study provided the first level 1 evidence for the 70-gene signature, identifying a prognostic capability irrespective of lymph node (LN) or hormone receptor (HR) status. However, the study did not support predictive value for the assay regarding adjuvant CT utility. The second prospective study, WSG-PlanB, confirmed the prognostic value of the 21-gene RS assay in HR-positive tumors with RS ≤ 11. A 5-year disease free survival (DFS) of 94% was identified in this group when treated with endocrine therapy (ET) alone regardless of N0 or N1 nodal status. The final new prospective study, TAILORx, confirmed the prognostic value of the 21-gene assay in N0 HR-positive disease, demonstrating a lack of CT benefit in patients with midrange RS. The information from these phase 3 studies confirms that MGAs are not interchangeable and that each provides different information for differing patient populations. Prognosis-only is supported for the 70-gene signature while both prognosis and the predictive value of CT are provided by the 21-gene assay. This review assesses and contrasts these phase 3 studies in the context of target populations and clinical utility. <br>	1435	265	11
Biological regulation of diacylglycerol kinases in normal and neoplastic tissues: New opportunities for cancer immunotherapy.	In the recent years, the arsenal of anti-cancer therapies has evolved to target T lymphocytes and restore their capacity to destroy tumor cells. However, the clinical success is limited, with a large number of patients that never responds and others that ultimately develop resistances. Overcoming the hypofunctional state imposed by solid tumors to T cells has revealed critical but challenging due to the complex strategies that tumors employ to evade the immune system. The Diacylglycerol kinases (DGK) limit DAG-dependent functions in T lymphocytes and their upregulation in tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes contribute to limit T cell cytotoxic potential. DGK blockade could reinstate T cell attack on tumors, limiting at the same time tumor cell growth, thanks to the DGK positive input into several oncogenic pathways. In this review we summarize the latest findings regarding the regulation of specific DGK isoforms in healthy and anergic T lymphocytes, as well as their contribution to oncogenic phenotypes. We will also revise the latest advances in the search for pharmacological inhibitors and their potential as anti-cancer agents, either alone or in combination with immunomodulatory agents. <br>	1030	186	7

Evaluation of the cancer stem cell marker DCLK1 in patients with lymph node metastases of head and neck cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLymph node metastases are frequently detected in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Little is known about biomarkers expressed in lymph node metastases or their influence on clinical outcome. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is one marker that might be associated with outcome, owing to its correlation with stem cell-like characteristics. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe assessed the expression of DCLK1 in 74 postoperatively irradiated patients in histologically confirmed HNSCC lymph node metastases. Statistical analysis of the association with DCLK1 on clinical outcomes was performed. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDCLK1 was expressed in 63.5% of our patient cohort. DCLK1(+) HNSCC patients, compared with those without DCLK1 expression, showed a significantly poorer time to recurrence. Moreover, we observed a significantly poorer time to recurrence in HPV(-) HNSCC patients, and significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival rates in HPV(-) oropharyngeal cancer patients, compared with HPV(+) patients with these cancers. HPV(+) patients showed no significant differences in survival time according to DCLK1 expression. However, recurrent disease occurred in only DCLK1(+) patients. Mulitivariate analysis showed that DCLK1 expression in lymph node metastases is an independent marker for recurrence. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDCLK1 expression might be associated with poorer clinical outcomes in HNSCC patients, specifically in HPV(-) move patients. However, larger studies are required to verify our results. <br>	1269	610	13
Di- and tri-substituted s-triazine derivatives: Synthesis, characterization, anticancer activity in human breast-cancer cell lines, and developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos.	Here we report on a small library based on a 4-aminobenzonitile-s-triazine moiety. We used a straightforward orthogonal synthetic pathway to prepare di- and tri-substituted s-triazine derivatives, whose basic structure was modified. The newly synthesized compounds were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental analysis. They showed strong anticancer activity against two human breast cancer cell lines (MIDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), with IC50 values less than 1 µM. These s-triazine compounds were generally more selective towards hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 than the triple negative MDA-MB-231 cell line. Zebrafish embryos were used to test the developmental toxicity of the target compounds in vivo. The phenotype of embryos treated with the derivatives resembled that of those treated with estrogen disruptors. This observation strongly supports the notion that that these compounds induce their anticancer activity in human breast cancer cells via targeting the estrogen and progesterone receptors. <br>	896	162	8
Design and synthesis of diphenylpyrimidine derivatives (DPPYs) as potential dual EGFR T790M and FAK inhibitors against a diverse range of cancer cell lines.	A new class of pyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized as potential dual FAK and EGFRT790M inhibitors using a fragment-based drug design strategy. This effort led to the identification of the two most active inhibitors, namely 9a and 9f, against both FAK (IC50 = 1.03 and 3.05 nM, respectively) and EGFRT790M (IC50 = 3.89 and 7.13 nM, respectively) kinase activity. Moreover, most of these compounds also exhibited strong antiproliferative activity against the three evaluated FAK-overexpressing pancreatic cancer (PC) cells (AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Panc-1) and two drug-resistant cancer cell lines (breast cancer MCF-7/adr cells and lung cancer H1975 cells) at concentrations lower than 6.936 μM. In addition, 9a was also effective in the in vivo assessment conducted in a FAK-driven human AsPC-1 cell xenograft mouse model. Overall, this study offers a new insight into the treatment of hard to treat cancers. <br>	783	154	5
"I am not a statistic" ovarian cancer survivors' views of factors that influenced their long-term survival.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough a high proportion of women with advanced stage ovarian cancer die within five years, approximately 30% will survive longer than this. The factors contributing to exceptional survival are currently poorly understood. The viewpoints of ovarian cancer survivors were qualitatively explored to determine the factors they felt have influenced their exceptional ovarian cancer survival. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFour focus groups, one each in Los Angeles (California), Ann Arbor (Michigan), New York (New York) and Edmonton (Alberta, Canada), were conducted with women who had survived at least five years. Physical activity, diet, meditation, prayer, treatment, complementary medicine, and side effects were explored in semi-structured discussions. The audiotaped sessions were transcribed and coded and then analyzed using Dedoose Version 8.0.35, a qualitative analysis software. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOf the 26 women who participated, 23 had advanced stage disease. Three overarching themes emerged: (a) survivors had improved their 'lifestyles', including but not limited to fitness and diet; (b) survivors were able to draw on strong support systems, which included family, friends, support groups, faith communities, and healthcare workers; and (c) survivors had a strong life purpose, which manifested as positivity, taking charge of their lives, and advocating for themselves. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLong-term survivors have varying experiences with their cancer, but identified lifestyle modification, motivation and persistence, strong life purpose, and strong support systems as key elements in their better survival. These preliminary findings indicate the need for further prospective studies to determine whether meaningful differences exist between short term and long term survivors on these characteristics. <br>	1517	702	10
Selective apoptosis-inducing activity of synthetic hydrocarbon-stapled SOS1 helix with d-amino acids in H358 cancer cells expressing KRASG12C.	Lung cancer is one of the most malignant tumors with the highest morbidity and mortality. Most of them are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRASG12C gene mutation is an important driving factor for NSCLC. However, the development of high-affinity inhibitors targeting KRASG12C mutants remains a daunting challenge. Here, we report the design and development of a series of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides containing d-amino acids to mimic the alpha helix of SOS1. D-hydrocarbon-stapled peptides maintain good alpha helix structure and bind to KRASG12C with high affinity. Subsequent anti-proliferation experiments indicated that D-hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 5 inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC H358 cells carrying KRASG12C. However, it showed no significant anti-proliferative effect on KRASG12S-positive A549 cells, suggesting that peptide 5 selectively inhibits KRASG12C-driven tumor cells. D-hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 5 could also cause the cell cycle of H358 cells to arrest in the G2/M phase and induce apoptosis. No significant cell arrest and apoptosis were observed in A549 cells treated by peptide 5. In summary, the introduction of d-amino acids could improve the affinity and cell selectivity of hydrocarbon peptides. We hope that peptides containing D-form amino acids can provide strategies for further optimization of the KRASG12C/SOS1 inhibitor. <br>	1180	212	12
A Third Shot at EGFR: New Opportunities in Cancer Therapy.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors were among the first type of targeted agents discovered in cancer and currently constitute the standard of care for a wide range of lung and colon malignancies. However, the therapeutic progress achieved with these drugs has been accompanied by the identification of an ever-increasing number of acquired resistance mechanisms that inevitably appear in nearly all patients. Increased knowledge on EGFR biochemistry, cellular crosstalk, and resistance pathways provides an opportunity to establish effective combination therapies and discover novel-acting inhibitors that prevent or overcome therapeutic resistance. One such strategy is the selective blockade of circulating growth factors such as EGF. In this review, we address the uses and limitations of approved EGFR inhibitors and explore the potential of drug combinations and new third avenues to block the activation of the EGFR. <br>	809	139	5

The influence of adjuvant therapy on survival in patients with indeterminate margins following surgery for non-small cell lung cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe significance of indeterminate margins following surgery for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown. We evaluated the influence of adjuvant therapy on survival in patients whose cancer showed indeterminate margins. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPatients whose cancer showed indeterminate margins following surgery for NSCLC were identified in the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2015, and stratified by receipt of adjuvant treatment. The primary outcome was overall survival, which was evaluated with multivariable Cox proportional hazards. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIndeterminate margins occurred in 0.31% of 232,986 patients undergoing surgery for NSCLC and was associated with worse survival compared with margin negative resection (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-1.67). Anatomic resection was protective against the finding of indeterminate margins in logistic regression. Amongst 553 patients with indeterminate margins, 343 (62%) received no adjuvant therapy, 96 (17%) received adjuvant chemotherapy, 33 (6%) received adjuvant radiation, and 81 (15%) received adjuvant chemoradiation. Any mode of adjuvant therapy was not associated with improved survival compared with no further treatment. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe finding of indeterminate margins is reported in 0.31% of patients undergoing curative-intent surgery for NSCLC. This was associated with worse overall survival compared with complete resection and not mitigated by adjuvant therapy. The risks and benefits of adjuvant therapy should be carefully considered for patients with indeterminate margins after surgery for NSCLC. <br>	1355	581	11
Validation of the Prognostic Significance of the Prognostic Stage Group According to the Eighth Edition of American Cancer Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: An Analysis From Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 Database.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe eighth edition of the American Cancer Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for breast cancer put forward the prognostic stage groups for the first time based on the traditional anatomic tumor-node-metastasis staging system. Our study intends to validate the predictive significance of the eighth edition staging system in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe collected and accessed 26,589 eligible cases of TNBC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2010-2015) and reclassified the patient cohort according to the eighth edition of the AJCC staging system into anatomic and prognostic stages. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe results showed that more than half of the patients upstaged in the prognostic stage when compared with the anatomic stage. By comparing with the anatomic stage, the prognostic stage had a higher likelihood ratio and linear trend χ2 values. The prognostic stage group also had higher Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion values than the anatomic stage group. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe prognostic staging system in TNBC patients performs more optimistic prognostic stratification and predictability than the anatomic staging system. Moreover, the latest AJCC staging system has a milestone importance to the history of breast cancer staging system. <br>	1116	599	8
DUBs, Hypoxia, and Cancer.	Alterations in protein ubiquitylation and hypoxia are commonly associated with cancer. Ubiquitylation is carried out by three sequentially acting ubiquitylating enzymes and can be opposed by deubiquitinases (DUBs), which have emerged as promising drug targets. Apart from protein localization and activity, ubiquitylation regulates degradation of proteins, among them hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Thereby, various E3 ubiquitin ligases and DUBs regulate HIF abundance. Conversely, several E3s and DUBs are regulated by hypoxia. While hypoxia is a powerful HIF regulator, less is known about hypoxia-regulated DUBs and their impact on HIFs. Here, we review current knowledge about the relationship of E3s, DUBs, and hypoxia signaling. We also discuss the reciprocal regulation of DUBs by hypoxia and use of DUB-specific drugs in cancer. <br>	726	124	8
R Loops and Their Composite Cancer Connections.	R loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures consisting of an RNA molecule that has invaded duplex DNA. R-loop structures have normal functions in regulating gene expression, class-switch recombination, telomere stability, and mitochondrial DNA replication. However, unscheduled R-loop accumulation is a driver of DNA replication stress and genome instability. Meanwhile, R loops and associated transcription-replication conflicts have been observed in cells that have lost tumor-suppressor genes or have activated oncogenes. While ectopic R loops can both disrupt epigenetic states, and promote genome instability, in most cases the hinted-at direct links between R loops and cancer development are lacking. Here, we review the possible influences of altered R-loop stability and metabolism on cancer development and discuss how R-loop accumulation might be exploited to benefit cancer patients. <br>	784	135	6
Tissue Site and the Cancer Immunity Cycle.	Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBT) has revolutionized cancer treatment; however, the cellular and molecular factors that govern responsiveness to immunotherapy remain poorly understood. One emerging area of clinical importance is differential responsiveness to CBT across different tissue sites of tumor growth. Each tissue site in the body can contain unique tissue-resident immune cells from both the lymphoid and the myeloid compartment and differences in tissue-specific immune cell composition might predispose tumors in certain tissue sites to be more or less responsive to immunotherapy. Understanding the interplay between tissue-resident and systemic immune responses against tumors will help to determine how to better therapeutically target the immune system to fight cancer. This review summarizes clinical and preclinical investigations of tissue-specific antitumor immune responses and how they influence the tumor immune microenvironment and the efficacy of immunotherapy. <br>	865	139	5
Impaired Muscle Regeneration in Cancer-Associated Cachexia.	Muscle wasting, a cardinal feature of cancer-associated cachexia (CAC), is a major clinical problem with few therapeutic options. In this Forum article we discuss cellular mechanisms of CAC, focusing on impaired muscle regeneration. We highlight muscle progenitor cell dysfunction and metabolism as two variables contributing to impaired regeneration in CAC. <br>	314	53	3
Phages Enter the Fight against Colorectal Cancer.	Intestinal microbiota undergo significant changes in colorectal cancer (CRC). Zheng et al. (Nat. Biomed. Eng., 2019) observe detrimental overpopulation of Fusobacterium nucleatum in mice and patients, suppressing the beneficial butyrate-producing Clostridium butyricum. Phage-guided irinotecan-loaded dextran nanoparticles promote release of bacterial-derived butyrate, while F. nucleatum and CRC cells are eliminated. These findings describe a possible novel therapeutic strategy for CRC. <br>	436	65	8
Long-term psychological distress in breast cancer survivors and their matched controls: A cross-sectional study.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBreast cancer survivors often experience psychological distress shortly after diagnosis. Long-term psychological effects, however, have not been clearly demonstrated. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis cross-sectional cohort study included 350 breast cancer survivors and 350 age-matched and general-practitioner-matched women. The median follow-up was 10 years. Using logistic regression we compared breast cancer survivors with controls on having (severe) symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, as measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. In multivariable logistic regression, we adjusted the results for a history of depression or prescription of antidepressants. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLarger proportions of breast cancer survivors experienced symptoms of depression (10.6%) compared with controls (4.9%) and symptoms of anxiety (18.6%) compared with controls (16.3%). The odds of symptoms of depression (OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.3-4.2), severe symptoms of depression (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.1-10.3) and severe symptoms of anxiety (OR 2.1, 95%CI, 1.1-4.0) were significantly higher for breast cancer survivors than for controls, even after adjusting for history of depression or prescription of antidepressants. No significant difference was seen for mild symptoms of anxiety. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBreast cancer survivors have an increased risk of symptoms of depression, including severe symptoms, and severe symptoms of anxiety compared with controls, for up to at least 10 years after diagnosis. <br>	1236	610	10

Effect of acupuncture on lung cancer-related fatigue: study protocol for a multi-center randomized controlled trial.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFatigue is one of the primary symptoms in lung cancer, with a prevalence of 88.0% in survivors of cancer, and an even higher prevalence post resection surgery. Effective fatigue control after lung cancer surgery is important for patient recovery and quality of life. Some studies have shown that acupuncture might be effective in treating cancer-related fatigue; however, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of suitable sample size are limited. <br><b>METHOD/DESIGN:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a multi-center, patient-blinded RCT. A total of 320 eligible patients will be recruited in four centers and randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group or the sham acupuncture group in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment will be given twice per week for 12 sessions. Treatment will be given at acupoints GV20, GV29, CV12, CV6, CV4, and bilateral LI4, LR3, SP6, ST36. The primary outcome will be assessed using the Chinese version of The Brief Fatigue Inventory. The secondary outcomes will be measured using The European Organization for Research and The Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The primary outcome will be assessed at all main points (baseline, the 3rd week, the 6th week, and at follow up time points) and the secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline and the 6th week. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used in this RCT. <br><b>DISCUSSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis trial protocol provides an example of the clinical application acupuncture treatment in the management of lung cancer-related fatigue. If the acupuncture treatment protocol confirms that acupuncture is an effective and safe option for lung cancer-related fatigue, it can be adopted as a standardized treatment. <br><b>TRIAL REGISTRATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1900022831. Registered on 27 April 2019. URL: http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=37823. <br>	1534	940	12
Vaginal douching in Zambia: a risk or benefit to women in the fight against cervical cancer: a retrospective cohort study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCervical cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer related deaths in 2013 among women in Zambia. We determined factors associated with vaginal douching with any solution other than water and examined its role as a risk factor for abnormal cervical lesions among Zambian women. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Cervical Cancer Prevention Program in Zambia among 11,853 women (15 years or older) who had screened for cervical cancer from 6 provinces of Zambia. Stata version 15 was used to analyze the data. Investigator led stepwise logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for various characteristics, with vaginal douching with any solution as primary outcome and abnormal cervical lesions as secondary outcome. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDouching with any solution other than water was practiced by 8.1% (n = 960) of the study participants. Older women (35-44 and 45 years or older) vs young women (15-24 years old) were less likely to douche with a solution (AOR 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57-0.97, p = 0.027 and AOR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49-0.87, P = 0.004), respectively, and so were women in informal employment compared to housewives (AOR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58-0.89, p = 0.002). Odds of douching were higher among women with secondary vs. no formal education (AOR 1.64; 95% CI: 1.15-2.35, P = 0.007), and among women who used condoms sometimes compared to those who never with their regular sexual partners (AOR 1.19; 95% CI: 1.01-1.40, PP = 0.037). About 12.2% of study participants had abnormal cervical lesions. The use of either vinegar, ginger, lemon, salt or sugar solution was associated with increased risk of abnormal cervical lesions (AOR 7.37; 95% CI: 1.43-38.00, p = 0.017) compared to using water. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe find an association between douching with a solution and a woman's age, educational attainment, occupation and condom use. Vaginal douching with either vinegar, ginger, lemon, salt or sugar solution was associated with increased risk for abnormal cervical lesions. We recommend further research on ever vs never douching and the risk for abnormal cervical lesions. <br>	1812	957	14
Associations between ambient air pollution and cancer incidence in Taiwan: an ecological study of geographical variations.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAir pollution is a global public health concern. The World Health Organization has recently set up a goal of saving 7 million people globally by 2030 from air pollution related death. We conducted an ecological study of geographical variation to explore the association between air pollution (specifically, particulate matter <2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5], particulate matter <10 μm in aerodynamic diameter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, and ozone) and cancer incidence in Taiwan, from 2012 to 2016. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this study, the yearly average concentrations of each air pollutant at 75 air quality monitoring stations were calculated, and using the kriging method, the concentrations were extrapolated to each and every geographical central point of 349 local administrative areas of Taiwan. Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the age-adjusted cancer incidence rates and various air pollutants were calculated by stratifying genders and urbanization degrees of the local administrative areas. A total of 70 correlation coefficients were calculated. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn total, 17 correlation coefficients were significantly positive at an alpha level of 0.05. Among these, four correlation coefficients between the age-adjusted cancer incidence rates and PM2.5 levels remained significant after Bonferroni correction. For men in developing towns, general towns, and aged towns and for women in aged towns, the age-adjusted cancer incidence rates increased 13.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.8-17.6), 11 (95% CI, 5.6-16.4), 16.7 (95% CI, 6.9-26.4), and 11.9 (95% CI, 5.6-18.2) per 100,000 populations, respectively, for every 1 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 concentrations. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA significantly positive correlation was observed between the PM2.5 level and cancer incidence rate after multiple testing correction. <br>	1563	877	8
Copy number variation is highly correlated with differential gene expression: a pan-cancer study.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCancer is a heterogeneous disease with many genetic variations. Lines of evidence have shown copy number variations (CNVs) of certain genes are involved in development and progression of many cancers through the alterations of their gene expression levels on individual or several cancer types. However, it is not quite clear whether the correlation will be a general phenomenon across multiple cancer types. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this study we applied a bioinformatics approach integrating CNV and differential gene expression mathematically across 1025 cell lines and 9159 patient samples to detect their potential relationship. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur results showed there is a close correlation between CNV and differential gene expression and the copy number displayed a positive linear influence on gene expression for the majority of genes, indicating that genetic variation generated a direct effect on gene transcriptional level. Another independent dataset is utilized to revalidate the relationship between copy number and expression level. Further analysis show genes with general positive linear influence on gene expression are clustered in certain disease-related pathways, which suggests the involvement of CNV in pathophysiology of diseases. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study shows the close correlation between CNV and differential gene expression revealing the qualitative relationship between genetic variation and its downstream effect, especially for oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. It is of a critical importance to elucidate the relationship between copy number variation and gene expression for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. <br>	1385	644	9
Optimal treatment for elderly patients with resectable proximal gastric carcinoma: a real world study based on National Cancer Database.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHigh perioperative morbidity, mortality, and uncertain outcome of surgery in octogenarians with proximal gastric carcinoma (PGC) pose a dilemma for both patients and physicians. We aim to evaluate the risks and survival benefits of different strategies treated in this group. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOctogenarians (≥80 years) with resectable proximal gastric carcinoma who were recommended for surgery were identified from National Cancer Database during 2004-2013. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPatients age ≥ 80 years with PGC were less likely to be recommended or eventually undergo surgery compared to younger patients. Patients with surgery had a significantly better survival than those without surgery (5-year OS: 26% vs. 7%, p < 0.001), especially in early stage patients. However, additional chemotherapy (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.82-1.08, P = 0.36) or radiotherapy (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.84-1.13, P = 0.72) had limited benefits. On multivariate analysis, surgery (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.86, P = 0.002) was a significant independent prognostic factor, while extensive surgery had no survival benefit (Combined organ resection: HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.22-2.91, P = 0.004; number of lymph nodes examined: HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.00, P = 0.10). Surgery performed at academic and research (AR) medical center had the best survival outcome (5-year OS: 30% in AR vs. 18-27% in other programs, P < 0.001) and lowest risk (30-day mortality: 1.5% in AR vs. 3.6-6.6% in other programs, P < 0.001; 90-day mortality: 6.2% in AR vs. 13.6-16.4% in other programs, P < 0.001) compared to other facilities. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLess-invasive approach performed at academic and research medical center might be the optimal treatment for elderly patients aged ≥80 yrs. with early stage resectable PGC. <br>	1449	758	13
Dual oxidase 1 and NADPH oxidase 2 exert favorable effects in cervical cancer patients by activating immune response.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) not only can promote cancer progression, but also they have recently emerged as mediators of the mucosal immune system. However, the roles and clinical relevance of the collective or individual NADPH oxidase (NOX) family genes in cervical cancer have not been studied. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe investigated the clinical significance of the NOX family genes using data from 307 patients with cervical cancer obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Bioinformatics and experimental analyses were performed to examine NOX family genes in cervical cancer patients. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDual Oxidase1 (DUOX1) and Dual Oxidase 2 (DUOX2) mRNA levels were upregulated 57.9- and 67.5-fold, respectively, in cervical cancer patients. The protein expression of DUOX1, DUOX2, and NOX2 also identified in cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissues. Especially, DUOX1 and DUOX2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in patients infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16. Moreover, high DUOX1 mRNA levels were significantly associated with both favorable overall survival and disease-free survival in cervical cancer patients. High NOX2 mRNA levels was significantly associated with favorable overall survival. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed that high DUOX1 and NOX2 expression was significantly correlated with the enrichment of immune pathways related to interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-gamma, and natural killer (NK) cell signaling. Cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of known RNA transcript analyses indicated that the fraction of innate immune cells, including NK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and mast cells, was elevated in patients with high DUOX1 expression. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDUOX1 and NOX2 expression are associated with mucosal immunity activated in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and predicts a favorable prognosis in cervical cancer patients. <br>	1649	753	11
Integrated transcriptomic analysis reveals hub genes involved in diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe hunt for the molecular markers with specificity and sensitivity has been a hot area for the tumor treatment. Due to the poor diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC), the excision rate is often low, which makes it more urgent to find the ideal tumor markers. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRobust Rank Aggreg (RRA) methods was firstly applied to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PC tissues and normal tissues from GSE28735, GSE15471, GSE16515, and GSE101448. Among these DEGs, the highly correlated genes were clustered using WGCNA analysis. The co-expression networks and molecular complex detection (MCODE) Cytoscape app were then performed to find the sub-clusters and confirm 35 candidate genes. For these genes, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression model was applied and validated to build a diagnostic risk score model. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used and validated to build a prognostic model. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBased on integrated transcriptomic analysis, we identified a 19 gene module (SYCN, PNLIPRP1, CAP2, GNMT, MAT1A, ABAT, GPT2, ADHFE1, PHGDH, PSAT1, ERP27, PDIA2, MT1H, COMP, COL5A2, FN1, COL1A2, FAP and POSTN) as a specific predictive signature for the diagnosis of PC. Based on the two consideration, accuracy and feasibility, we simplified the diagnostic risk model as a four-gene model: 0.3034*log2(MAT1A)-0.1526*log2(MT1H) + 0.4645*log2(FN1) -0.2244*log2(FAP), log2(gene count). Besides, a four-hub gene module was also identified as prognostic model = - 1.400*log2(CEL) + 1.321*log2(CPA1) + 0.454*log2(POSTN) + 1.011*log2(PM20D1), log2(gene count). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIntegrated transcriptomic analysis identifies two four-hub gene modules as specific predictive signatures for the diagnosis and prognosis of PC, which may bring new sight for the clinical practice of PC. <br>	1558	823	10
System-level responses to cisplatin in pro-apoptotic stages of breast cancer MCF-7 cell line.	Cisplatin ceases cell division and induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines. It is well established that cisplatin alters the expression of many genes involved in several cellular processes and pathways including transcription, p53 signaling pathway, and apoptosis. However, system-wide responses to cisplatin in breast cancer cell lines have not been studied. Therefore, we have used a network analysis approach to unveil such responses at early stages of drug treatment. To do this, we have first identified those genes that are responding to cisplatin treatment in MCF-7 cell line. Network and gene ontology analyses were then employed to uncover the molecular pathways affected by cisplatin treatment. Then the results obtained from cisplatin-treated MCF7 cell line were compared to those obtained from other cancer cell lines at comparable time points. In conclusion, we found that ADCY9, GSK3B, MAPK14, NCK1, NCOA2, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PTK2, RHOB act as hub genes in the cisplatin-responsive regulatory network at the pro-apoptotic stages. The results could be useful in finding new drugs to target these genes in order to obtain similar responses. <br>	980	181	9
Long noncoding RNA AC114812.8 promotes the progression of bladder cancer through miR-371b-5p/FUT4 axis.	Bladder cancer (BC) brings a heavy burden to afflicted patients worldwide. In order to find new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for this disease, we investigated the role of a novel lncRNA, AC114812.8, in bladder cancer progression. Clone formation and CCK-8 assays were used to detect the proliferative capacity of the cells, and the transwell assay was used to explore their invasion and migration abilities. Wound healing experiments were also used to detect cell migration. Luciferase reporter assays were used to investigate the interactions between lncRNA, target gene and miRNA. The expression of FUT4 and marker genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition was explored through western blot analysis. Our findings revealed that AC114812.8 was significantly upregulated in BC and could markedly facilitate the proliferation, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, duel-luciferase reporter assay revealed that AC114812.8 could regulate the FUT4 expression level by sponging miR-371b-5p to facilitate BC progression. We detected the levels of EMT-related biomarkers in AC114812.8-overexpressing BC cells by western blot analysis and found that AC114812.8 could promote EMT process. Rescue experiments showed that miR-371b-5p could rescue the effect of AC114812.8 on proliferation and metastasis of BC. Our results suggest that AC114812.8 could be a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for bladder cancer. <br>	1282	231	11
Hsa_circ_0075341 is up-regulated and exerts oncogenic properties by sponging miR-149-5p in cervical cancer.	Increasing evidence revealed that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in tumor progression. In the present study, we explored the roles and underlying mechanisms of hsa_circ_0075341 in cervical cancer development. Our data showed that the expression of hsa_circ_0075341 was significantly upregulated and associated with larger tumor size, advanced FIGO stage, and lymph-node metastasis in cervical cancer patients. Hsa_circ_0075341 inhibition reduced cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. In mechanism, hsa_circ_0075341 negatively regulated miR-149-5p in cervical cancer progression. In addition, AURKA was confirmed as a direct target of miR-149-5p in cervical cancer and positively regulated by hsa_circ_0075341. Collectively, our data suggested that hsa_circ_0075341 promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion through regulating the miR-149-5p/AURKA axis, which provided a novel therapeutic target for cervical cancer treatment. <br>	856	135	6
Pooled overall survival and safety data from the pivotal phase II studies (NP28673 and NP28761) of alectinib in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.	<b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA pooled analysis of two open-label phase II studies of alectinib (NP28673 [NCT01801111] and NP28761 [NCT01871805]) demonstrated clinical activity in patients with advanced, anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with crizotinib. Longer-term and final pooled analyses of overall survival (OS) and safety data from the two studies are presented here. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe pooled population totaled 225 patients (NP28673: n = 138, NP28761: n = 87) who received 600 mg oral alectinib twice daily until disease progression, death, or withdrawal. OS was defined as the time from date of first treatment to date of death, regardless of cause. OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) determined using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method. Safety was assessed through adverse event (AE) reporting. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBaseline characteristics were generally comparable between the studies. At final data cutoff (October 27, 2017 [NP28673], October 12, 2017 [NP28761]; median pooled follow-up time, ∼21 months), 53.3% of patients had died, 39.1% were alive and in follow-up, and 7.6% had withdrawn consent or were lost to follow-up. Alectinib demonstrated a median OS of 29.1 months (95% CI 21.3-39.0). No new or unexpected safety findings were observed. The most common all-grade AEs included constipation (39.1%), fatigue (35.1%), peripheral edema (28.4%), myalgia (26.2%), and nausea (24.0%). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUpdated results from this pooled analysis further demonstrate that alectinib has robust clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced, ALK+ NSCLC pretreated with crizotinib. <br>	1418	764	12
Clinicopathologic features and genetic characteristics of the BRCA1/2 mutation in Turkish breast cancer patients.	The aim of this study was to identify the frequency and spectrum of germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic alterations in a cohort of patients with breast carcinoma. In this study, a total of 603 breast cancer subjects from Turkey were screened for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations using HDA and Sanger sequencing. In the present study, 21 BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants were detected in 30 patients and BRCA1/2 mutations were significantly associated with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer. Analysis of overall survival for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers showed a trend for poor overall survival only in BRCA1 carriers, although this was not statistically significant in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. The c.5266dupC mutation is one of the most frequently reported mutations in BRCA1 and was identified in five breast cancer patients in our study. The most common BRCA2 gene mutations in the present study were c.8940delA and c.9097dupA, which were found in seven patients. We found mostly BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers in those patients who showed hormone-positive features. In conclusion, our data showed differences in the distribution of the mutation spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Turkey. <br>	1014	195	8
Effect of bisphosphonate on the prevention of bone loss in patients with gastric cancer after gastrectomy: A randomized controlled trial.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBone loss is highly prevalent after gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients. Therefore, the efficacy of medical treatment should be evaluated in patients undergoing gastrectomy. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe conducted an unblinded, randomized controlled trial of patients who underwent gastrectomy to treat gastric cancer. The intention-to-treat participants (n = 107) were randomly assigned to receive either alendronate at a weekly dose of 70 mg and daily elemental calcium (500 mg) with cholecalciferol (1000 IU) or daily elemental calcium (500 mg) with cholecalciferol (1000 IU) only. The primary endpoint was defined by the changes in bone mineral density of four measurement sites: the lumbar spine, femur neck, total hip, and trochanter. Changes in bone turnover markers, osteocalcin and collagen I carboxyterminal telopeptide were also observed. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt baseline, there were no differences between the two groups in bone mineral density. In the lumbar spine and trochanter, there were no significant percentage changes compared with the baseline in the alendronate group, but a significant decrease was noted in the control group (p < 0.001 for both lumbar spine and trochanter). In the femur neck and total hip, a larger decrease was observed compared with the baseline in the control group (p < 0.001 for both femur neck and total hip). Significant percentage increases in serum osteocalcin compared with baseline were noted in the control group (p for trend <0.001), but there was no change in the alendronate group (p for trend = 0.713). Collagen I carboxyterminal telopeptide significantly declined in the alendronate group over 12 months (p for trend <0.001). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPrevention and treatment with bisphosphonate effectively reduces bone loss by suppressing bone resorption in gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy. <br>	1530	760	12
MicroRNA-429 inhibits bone metastasis in breast cancer by regulating CrkL and MMP-9.	Bone metastasis is common in late-stage breast cancer patients and leads to skeletal-related events that affect the quality of life and decrease survival. Numerous miRNAs have been confirmed to be involved in metastatic breast cancer, such as the miR200 family. Our previous study identified microRNA-429 (miR-429) as a regulatory molecule in breast cancer bone metastasis. However, the effects of miR-429 and its regulatory axis in the metastatic breast cancer bone microenvironment have not been thoroughly investigated. We observed a positive correlation between miR-429 expression in clinical tissues and the bone metastasis-free interval and a negative correlation between miR-429 expression and the degree of bone metastasis. We cultured bone metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells and used conditioned medium (CM) to detect the effect of miR-429 on osteoblast and osteoclast cells in vitro. We constructed an orthotopic bone destruction model and a left ventricle implantation model to examine the effect of miR-429 on the metastatic bone environment in vivo. The transfection experiments showed that the expression levels of V-crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog-like (CrkL) and MMP-9 were negatively regulated by miR-429. The in vitro coculture experiments showed that miR-429 promoted osteoblast differentiation and that CrkL promoted osteoclast differentiation. The two animal models showed that miR-429 diminished local bone destruction and distant bone metastasis but CrkL enhanced these effects. Furthermore, CrkL and MMP-9 expression decreased simultaneously in response to increased miR-429 expression. These findings further reveal the possible mechanism and effect of the miR-429/CrkL/MMP-9 regulatory axis in the bone microenvironment in breast cancer bone metastasis. <br>	1535	277	11
PEG-DAAO conjugate: A promising tool for cancer therapy optimized by protein engineering.	The flavoenzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) represents a potentially good option for enzyme prodrug therapy as it produces H2O2 using D-amino acids as substrates, compounds present at low concentration in vivo and that can be safely administered to regulate H2O2 production. We optimized the cytotoxicity of the treatment by: i) using an efficient enzyme variant active at low O2 and D-alanine concentrations (mDAAO); ii) improving the stability and half-life of mDAAO and the enhanced permeability and retention effect by pegylation; and iii) inhibiting the antioxidant cellular system by a heme oxygenase-1 inhibitor (ZnPP). A very low amount of PEG-mDAAO (10mU, 50ng of enzyme) induces cytotoxicity on various tumor cell lines. Notably, PEG-mDAAO seems well suited for in vivo evaluation as it shows the same cytotoxicity at air saturation (21%) and 2.5% O2, a condition resembling the microenvironment found in the central part of tumors. <br>	804	154	4
Regulation of cell cycle by MDM2 in prostate cancer cells through Aurora Kinase-B and p21WAF1/CIP1 mediated pathways.	Overexpression of MDM2 oncoprotein has been detected in a large number of diverse human malignancies and has been shown to play both p53-dependent and p53-independent roles in oncogenesis. Our study was designed to explore the impact of MDM2 overexpression on the levels of various cell cycle regulatory proteins including Aurora kinase-B (AURK-B), CDC25C and CDK1, which are known to promote tumor progression and increase metastatic potential. Our data from human cell cycle RT2 prifiler PCR array experiments revealed significant changes in the expression profile of genes that are involved in different phases of cell cycle regulation in LNCaP-MST (MDM2 transfected) prostate cancer cells. Our current study has demonstrated a significant increase in the expression level of AURK-B, CDC25C, Cyclin A2, Cyclin B and CDK1 in LNCaP-MST cells as compared with wild type LNCaP cells that were modulated by MDM2 specific inhibitor Nutlin-3. In fact, the expression levels of the above- mentioned proteins were significantly altered at both mRNA and protein levels after treating the cells with 20 µM Nutlin-3 for 24 h. Additionally, the pro-apoptotic proteins including p53, p21, and Bax were elevated with the concomitant decrease in the key anti-apoptotic proteins following MDM2 inhibitor treatment. Also, Nutlin-3 treated cells demonstrated caspase-3 activation was observed with an in-vitro caspase-3 fluorescent assay performed with caspase 3/7 specific DEVD-amc substrate. Our results offer significant evidence towards the effectiveness of MDM2 inhibition in causing cell cycle arrest via blocking the transmission of signals through AURKB-CDK1 axis and inducing apoptosis in LNCaP-MST cancer cells. It is evident from our data that MDM2 overexpression probably is the primary cause for CDK1 up-regulation in the LNCaP-MST cells, which might have occurred possibly through activation of AURK-B. However, further studies in this direction should shed more light on the intracellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of Aurora kinase-B and CDK1 axis in MDM2 positive cancers. <br>	1782	333	10
Endogenous Stimuli-Responsive Linkers in Nanoliposomal Systems for Cancer Drug Targeting.	There are various drug delivery systems (DDSs) among which nanoliposomal formulations are among the most prominent. Despite the superiority of nanoliposomal DDSs compared to conventional drug delivery methods, recent reports have claimed that they can deliver small amounts of the injected dose to target site by passive targeting. However, our understanding of tumor microenvironment features, including dysregulation of pH, the high intracellular concentration of glutathione, change in the amount and expression of some enzymes, reactive oxygen species, hypoxia, and ATP concentrations, has driven the scope of research into the use of these endogenous stimuli for a design of smart linkers. These linkers optimize the release of payloads in favorable target sites and avoid premature releasing in non-favorable off-target sites. In this review, we discuss particular linkers, which are able to respond to the specific endogenous conditions, and could be used in nanoliposomal DDSs, based on pathophysiological changes that occur in tumors. Furthermore, structural and chemical properties of these linkers and other potential linkers, which could be used in nanoliposomal DDSs, have been reviewed. <br>	1033	177	6
Antisense LNA-loaded nanoparticles of star-shaped glucose-core PCL-PEG copolymer for enhanced inhibition of oncomiR-214 and nucleolin-mediated therapy of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells.	We aimed to inhibit overexpressed oncomiR-214 in cisplatin (CIS)-resistant ovarian cancer (OC) and perform targeted therapy of sensitized cells using a novel polymeric drug delivery system (DDS). A system of nanoparticles (NPs) of star-shaped glucose-core polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol (Glu-PCL-PEG) block copolymer containing cisplatin (CIS-PCL NPs) and locked nucleic acid (LNA) anti-miR-214 (LNA-PCL NPs) were prepared and anti-nucleolin aptamer was conjugated to the surface of prepared NPs to prepare Ap-CIS-PCL NPs and Ap-LNA-PCL NPs, respectively. The cancer-targeting ability of the NPs was confirmed and the CIS-resistant A2780 (A2780 R) cells were transfected with Ap-LNA-PCL NPs to inhibit oncomiR-214 and sensitize the cells to CIS. Next, the miR-214-inhibited cells were exposed to the Ap-CIS-NPs and the deracination efficiency of targeted DDS was evaluated. The oncomiR-214 in A2780 R cells were harnessed by Ap-LNA-PCL NPs, and nucleolin-mediated endocytosis of targeted polymeric DDSs containing CIS into miR-214-inhibited A2780 R cells caused enhanced apoptosis, in which was confirmed by apoptosis detection and evaluation of downstream genes expression. Targeted inhibition of miR-214 using developed NPs containing LNA decreases drug-resistant properties of cancer cells, which may enhance the efficiency of targeted DDSs. <br>	1172	219	6
Questioning the status quo: Should Gleason Grade Group 1 prostate cancer be considered a "negative core" in pre-radical prostatectomy risk nomograms? An international multicenter analysis.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo assess the impact of excluding Gleason Grade Group 1 (GG1) prostate cancer (PCa) cores from current pre-radical prostatectomy (RP) nomograms. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMulti-institutional retrospective chart review performed on all RP patients with prostate biopsy between 2008-2018. Patients individually assessed using Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Briganti nomograms using the following iterations: 1) Original [ORIG] - all available core data and 2) Selective [SEL] - GG1 cores considered negative. Nomogram outcomes, lymph node invasion - LNI, extracapsular extension - ECE, organ-confined disease - OCD, seminal vesicle invasion - SVI, compared across iterations and stratified based on biopsy GG. Clinically significant impact on management (CSIM) defined as change in LNI risk above or below 2% or 5% (Δ2/Δ5). Nomogram outcomes validated with RP pathology. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp7718 men met inclusion criteria. In men with GG2 who also had GG1 cores, SEL better predicted LNI (MSKCC - ORIG 4.97% vs. SEL 3.50%; Briganti - ORIG 4.81% vs. SEL 2.49%, RP outcome 2.46%), ECE (MSKCC - ORIG 40.91% vs. SEL 48.44%, RP outcome: 68.46%) and OCD (MSKCC - ORIG 57.87% vs. SEL 50.38%, RP outcome: 30.41%), but not SVI (MSKCC - ORIG 5.42% vs. SEL 3.34%, RP outcome: 5.62%). This was also consistent in patients with GG3-5 disease. The greatest impact of CSIM was on GG1-2 PCa; Δ2 and Δ5 in GG1 patients was 26.3-31.0% and 1.5-5.2%, respectively, and Δ2 and Δ5 in GG2 patients was 3.4-22.2% and 12.3-13.6%, respectively. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExcluding GG1 PCa cores from pre-RP nomograms better predicts final RP pathologic outcomes. More importantly, this may better reflect extent of true cancer burden. <br>	1401	767	16
RACK1 promotes the invasive activities and lymph node metastasis of cervical cancer via galectin-1.	Cervical cancer remains the first leading cause of cancer-related mortality among female reproductive system malignancies worldwide, and invasion and lymph node metastasis of cervical cancer represent the major reason for its poor prognosis. In this study, we found that RACK1 facilitated tumor cell invasion and lymphatic tube formation in vitro, as well as promoted lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in vivo in a galectin-1-dependent manner. Mechanism studies revealed that RACK1 promoted the expression and secretion of galectin-1 by reducing miR-1275 levels. Additionally, RACK1 also augmented galectin-1-induced downstream MEK/ERK, FAK, and AKT signaling via integrin-β1 in cervical cancer cells. Tissue microarray confirmed that RACK1 was upregulated in squamous intraepithelial lesion and cancer, and RACK1 was positively correlated with invasion/metastasis phenotype, galectin-1 expression, and unfavorable prognosis in cervical cancer cases. Human papillomavirus E6 oncogene contributes to increased expression of RACK1 via the enhancement of its O-GlcNAcylation and protein stability. Together, our results demonstrate that RACK1 stimulates tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis of cervical cancer via galectin-1 and imply that targeting RACK1/galectin-1 axis provides promising means for cervical cancer treatment. <br>	1166	195	7
Centromere Protein U (CENPU) enhances angiogenesis in triple-negative breast cancer by inhibiting ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of COX-2.	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by high vascularity, but anti-angiogenic therapies show poor efficacy. Centromere protein U (CENPU), a centromere component essential for mitosis, is associated with tumorigenesis in multiple cancers; however, little is known of its role in breast cancer. Here, we investigate its expression and function of promoting angiogenesis in TNBC. Immunohistochemical staining revealed high CENPU expression in TNBC tissue and high CENPU levels correlated significantly with poor distant metastasis-free and overall survival. Knockdown of CENPU in TNBC cells inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) production and significantly reduced tube formation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. In a mouse xenograft model, CENPU knockdown reduced TNBC tumor growth concomitant with a reduction in CD31+ microvessel density. Mechanistic studies revealed that CENPU promoted angiogenesis by inhibiting the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), leading to increased activation of the COX-2-p-ERK-HIF-1α-VEGFA signaling pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate a critical role for CENPU in COX-2-mediated signaling for angiogenesis, and identify a role of CENPU in regulating angiogenesis in TNBC. <br>	1148	191	8

Topical treatments for skin cancer.	Skin cancer is a broad term used to describe a number of different malignant indications of the skin. Skin cancers mostly comprise of the keratinocyte cancers [Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)], and melanoma. Surgical excision of these malignancies has been the preferred treatment of patients for decades. However, the decision to perform surgery can be affected by various considerations, including co-morbidities of the patient, the anatomical site of the lesion and potential intolerance for repeated excisions. Topical treatment of skin cancer may therefore be more appropriate in certain instances. Topical treatment potentially allows for higher drug levels at the tumor site, and may result in less overall toxicity than systemic agents. This review will specifically address the current agents used in topical treatment of skin cancers, and introduce emerging treatments from the natural product field that may also find utility in these indications. <br>	855	151	7
Long noncoding RNA DLX6-AS1 promotes breast cancer progression via miR-505-3p/RUNX2 axis.	The dysregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DLX6-AS1 has been identified to be involved in the development of several cancers, but its functional role and the underlying mechanism of DLX6-AS1 in breast cancer (BC) remains unknown. In the current study, the expression of DLX6-AS1 in the BC tissue samples was evaluated and the correlation between DLX6-AS1 expression and clinicopathological parameters were also analyzed. We found that DLX6-AS1 expression was much higher in tumor tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues and was positively associated with poor prognosis in BC patients. DLX6-AS1 knockdown significantly suppressed BC cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay validated that DLX6-AS1 acted as an endogenous sponge to miR-505-3p and negatively regulated its expression. Additionally, miR-505-3p inhibited runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression by directly bind to its 3'- untranslated region (3'-UTR) and overexpression of RUNX2 partially reversed the effect of miR-505-3p mimics on BC cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, in BC tissues, miR-505-3p expression level was inversely associated with DLX6-AS1 and RUNX2, respectively. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that DLX6-AS1 functioned as an oncogenic role that promoted BC proliferation and invasion through miR-505-3p/RUNX2 axis, which might serve as a potential therapeutic target for BC treatment. <br>	1276	228	8
TWIST1 transcriptionally regulates glycolytic genes to promote the Warburg metabolism in pancreatic cancer.	Reprogrammed glucose metabolism is essential for tumor initiation and development, especially for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Most cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed "the Warburg effect", to support uncontrolled proliferation and evade apoptosis. However, the direct regulators of the Warburg effect remain areas of active investigation. In this study, we found that the highly conserved transcription factor, TWIST1, is a crucial regulator of aerobic glycolysis in PDAC. Genetic silencing of TWIST1 significantly inhibited the glycolytic phenotypes of PDAC cells as revealed by reduced glucose uptake, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rate, which can be restored by re-expression of siRNA-resistant TWIST1. Moreover, tamoxifen-inducible expression of TWIST1 promoted the Warburg metabolism of PDAC cells. Mechanistically, by luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment, we showed that TWIST1 can directly increase the expression of several glycolytic genes, including SLC2A1, HK2, ENO1, and PKM2. Of note, the transcriptional regulation by TWIST1 was not dependent on HIF1α or c-Myc. In The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus accession GSE15471, we confirmed that TWIST1 was closely associated with the glycolysis pathway. Collectively, our findings indicate that TWIST1 is likely to act as important regulator of the Warburg effect in PDAC. <br>	1248	204	10
Stem-like tumor cells involved in heterogeneous vasculogenesis in breast cancer.	Sorafenib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic activity, has been used in liver cancer and kidney cancer treatment. However, clinical trials with sorafenib for breast cancer were stopped in phase Ⅲ due to limited efficacy. The existence of heterogeneous vasculatures involving tumor cells, such as vessel-like structures formed by vasculogenic mimicry and mosaic vessels, and their resistance to antiangiogenic therapy are thought to be a possible reason for failure of sorafenib therapy. Nevertheless, the features and mechanism of vasculogenesis by tumor cells remain unclear. In the present study, we found that breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSLCs, ALDH1+ cells) were involved in vasculogenic mimicry and mosaic vessel formation in triple-negative breast cancer tissues. Further, only ALDH1+ BCSLCs sorted from MDA-MB-231 could exhibit the tube formation and angiogenesis ability. Sorafenib could inhibit vascularization from endothelial cells rather than that from ALDH1+ cells. α-SMA was identified as a key molecule in vascular formation of BCSLCs. Mechanistically, HIF-1α enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of α-SMA by binding to the HRE element in the promoter directly and meanwhile increased the BCSLCs population. Interestingly, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, could inhibit both endothelial cell-derived and tumor cell-derived angiogenesis by down-regulating HIF-1α in breast cancer. Our finding clarified the possible reason for the poor outcome of anti-angiogenesis therapy and PEDF may have the therapeutic potential. <br>	1393	240	11
Delivery of platelet TPM3 mRNA into breast cancer cells via microvesicles enhances metastasis.	Platelets are implicated in the pathophysiology of breast and other cancers through their role in exchanging biomolecules with tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. Such exchange results in tumor-educated platelets with altered RNA expression profiles. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that platelet RNA profiles may be suitable as diagnostic biomarkers for cancer-related biological processes. In this study, we characterized the gene expression signatures of platelets in breast cancer by high throughput sequencing and RT-qPCR. Our results indicate that the expression of TPM3 mRNA is significantly elevated in platelets from breast cancer patients, compared to age-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, upregulation of TPM3 mRNA in platelets was found to be significantly correlated with metastasis in breast cancer patients. Finally, we report that platelet TPM3 mRNA is delivered into breast cancer cells through microvesicles and leads to enhanced migrative phenotype of breast cancer cells. In summary, our findings suggest that the transferal of platelet TPM3 mRNA into cancer cells via microvesicles promotes cancer cell migration, and thus platelet-derived TPM3 mRNA may be suitable biomarker for early diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. <br>	1089	185	8
Discordant and heterogeneous clinically relevant genomic alterations in circulating tumor cells vs plasma DNA from men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.	Circulating tumor cell (CTC) and cell-free (cf) DNA-based genomic alterations are increasingly being used for clinical decision-making in oncology. However, the concordance and discordance between paired CTC and cfDNA genomic profiles remain largely unknown. We performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on CTCs and cfDNA, and low-pass whole genome sequencing (lpWGS) on cfDNA to characterize genomic alterations (CNA) and tumor content in two independent prospective studies of 93 men with mCRPC treated with enzalutamide/abiraterone, or radium-223. Comprehensive analysis of 69 patient CTCs and 72 cfDNA samples from 93 men with mCRPC, including 64 paired samples, identified common concordant gains in FOXA1, AR, and MYC, and losses in BRCA1, PTEN, and RB1 between CTCs and cfDNA. Concordant PTEN loss and discordant BRCA2 gain were associated with significantly worse outcomes in Epic AR-V7 negative men with mCRPC treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide. We identified and externally validated CTC-specific genomic alternations that were discordant in paired cfDNA, even in samples with high tumor content. These CTC/cfDNA-discordant regions included key genomic regulators of lineage plasticity, osteomimicry, and cellular differentiation, including MYCN gain in CTCs (31%) that was rarely detected in cfDNA. CTC MYCN gain was associated with poor clinical outcomes in AR-V7 negative men and small cell transformation. In conclusion, we demonstrated concordance of multiple genomic alterations across CTC and cfDNA platforms; however, some genomic alterations displayed substantial discordance between CTC DNA and cfDNA despite the use of identical copy number analysis methods, suggesting tumor heterogeneity and divergent evolution associated with poor clinical outcomes.

Comparing Laparoscopic and Open Pancreaticoduodenectomy in Patients with Pancreatic Head Cancer: Oncologic outcomes and Inflammatory Scores.	<b>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBoth the technical and oncological safety of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) remain controversial in treating pancreatic head cancer. We evaluated the oncologic benefit of LPD and compared the inflammatory score between LPD and open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD). <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom January 2014 to March 2019, 61 patients with standard PD not combined with other organ resection were finally enrolled in this study. Among these patients, 27 underwent LPD and 34 underwent OPD. (registered on July 16th , 2019, and registration number is 2019-1411-001) RESULTS: The estimated blood loss (EBL) for the LPD group was less than that of the OPD group (p=0.003). The operation time was similar, as was the incidence of complications such as postoperative fistula, delayed gastric emptying. Overall survival was not different between LPD and OPD (44.62 vs 45.29 months, p=0.223). However, a significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) was seen in the LPD group (34.19 vs 23.27 months, p=0.027). No statistically significant differences were found in terms of the postoperative change in inflammatory scores and differentiated WBC counts. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLPD is not only safe and feasible in pancreatic head cancer patients but is associated with a reduced amount of EBL, favorable DFS. <br>	1084	472	10
Opioids for chronic non-cancer neuropathic pain. An updated systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy, tolerability and safety in randomized placebo-controlled studies of at least four weeks duration.	<b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis updated systematic review evaluated the efficacy, tolerability and safety of opioids compared to placebo in chronic non-cancer neuropathic pain. <br><b>DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClinicaltrials.gov, CENTRAL, PubMed, and PsychInfo were searched from October 2013 to June 2019. Randomized controlled trials comparing opioids with placebo and at least four weeks double-blinded duration were analysed. Primary outcomes were pain relief of 50% or greater, disability, tolerability and safety. Effects were summarized by a random effects model using risk differences (RD) or standardized mean differences (SMD). We added four new studies with 662 participants for a total of 16 included studies with 2199 participants. Study duration ranged between four and twelve weeks. Studies with a parallel and cross-over design: Based on low to moderate quality evidence, opioids (buprenorphine, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, tramadol) provided a clinically relevant pain relief of 50% or greater and reduction of disability compared to placebo. There was no clinically relevant harm with regards to the drop out rate due to adverse and serious adverse events by opioids compared to placebo. Enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal design: Based on low to moderate quality evidence, tapentadol provided a clinically relevant pain relief of 50% or greater and reduction of disability compared to placebo in diabetic polyneuropathy. There was no clinically relevant harm with regards to the drop out rate due to adverse and serious adverse events by tapentadol compared to placebo. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSome opioids provided a short-term substantial pain relief in highly selected patients in some neuropathic pain syndromes. <br>	1427	560	11
Hemi-Ablative Low-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy for Unilateral Localised Prostate Cancer.	<b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo report clinical outcomes of the Hemi-Ablative Prostate Brachytherapy (HAPpy) trial evaluating treatment-related toxicity and effectiveness of hemi-gland (HG) low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy as a focal approach to control unilateral localised prostate cancer. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSingle institution phase IIS pilot study of patients treated with 4D Focal Brachytherapy. The primary outcome was patient-reported toxicity 24 months post-implant. Secondary outcome was assessment of disease control. Outcomes in HG were compared to WG controls obtained from our prospective cohort registry by negative binomial (NB) and linear regression models. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPre-treatment demography was similar between the 30 HG cases and 362 WG controls. Post-implant dosimetry was similar for the prostate gland target volumes and significantly reduced for the urethra and bowel in HG relative to WG controls, but this did not translate into a difference in post-implant mean symptom scores between the two groups. Nevertheless, the change in score from baseline indicated that the impact on pre-treatment symptom status was less after HG implants. Only HG patients showed a return to baseline urinary scores as early as 12 months. Sexual potency was conserved in 73% and 67% of HG and WG patients respectively (p=0.84). Post-implant PSA kinetics revealed that baseline PSA was reduced at 24 months by 78% and 88% in HG and WG respectively (p<0.05). Treatment relapse occurred in 1 (3%) HG patient 55 months post-implant and in 9 (3%) WG cases 32 to 67 months post-implant. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis pilot study suggests that treatment-related toxicity and biochemical outcomes after HG implants are broadly similar to those observed with WG treatment despite the lower dose delivered by HG implants. <br>	1478	746	13
The effects of long-term opioid treatment on the immune system in chronic non-cancer pain patients: A systematic review.	<b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOpioids have been increasingly prescribed for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). An association between long-term opioid treatment (L-TOT) of CNCP patients and suppression of both the innate and the adaptive immune system has been proposed. This systematic review aims at investigating the effects of L-TOT on the immune system in CNCP patients. <br><b>DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the CINAHL for relevant articles was performed. Studies examining measures of both the innate and the adaptive immune system in adult CNCP patients in L-TOT (≥4 weeks of intake) were included. Outcomes and the level of evidence were analyzed. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThree-hundred-eighty-two studies were identified; however, 376 were excluded (352 inappropriate methodology, 21 duplicates, 3 full-text could not be obtained) and one RCT and five cross-sectional studies were included and analyzed. L-TOT compared with no treatment was associated with a lower percentage of NK cells, a lower absolute number of CD56bright NK cells, a higher absolute number of IL-2 activated NK cells and a higher concentration of IL-1β as a response to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists stimulation (Pam3CSK4, LPS, Imiquimod). No other significant differences were reported. Generalizability of the results was limited due to inconsistency of outcomes and an overall low quality of the studies. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspL-TOT may alter the immune system in CNCP patients, but the level of evidence is still weak. More studies are needed to clarify the impact of L-TOT on immune system function. <br>	1330	739	12
Efficacy of Ultrasound and Shear Wave Elastography for the Diagnosis of Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema.	<b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo assess the feasibility of ultrasound and shear wave elastography (SWE) in the diagnosis of breast cancer-related lymphedema. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspForty-one patients with a history of unilateral breast surgery and axillary dissection or sentinel lymph node excision were included in this prospective study. The patients were classified as having normal findings, latent lymphedema, and clinical lymphedema on the basis of a physical examination, lymphedema index scores, and limb circumference measurements. The thickness and stiffness of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the forearm and arm were measured by ultrasound and SWE. The thickness and stiffness of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the affected limb and contralateral limbs of the normal, latent lymphedema, and clinical lymphedema groups were compared. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe mean age ± SD of the 41 patients was 55.42 ± 10.12 years. There were 15 patients with normal findings, 10 with latent lymphedema, and 16 with clinical lymphedema. In the latent lymphedema group, the thickness measurements of the cutaneous tissue of the affected forearm and the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the affected arm were significantly greater than those of the contralateral forearm and arm (P = .034; P = .022; and P = .002, respectively), and the stiffness measurements of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the affected forearm were significantly greater than those of the contralateral forearm (P = .011; and P = .002). In the clinical lymphedema group, the thickness and stiffness measurements of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the affected forearm and arm were significantly greater than those of the contralateral limb (P < .001-P = .032). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUltrasound and SWE are effective for diagnosing breast cancer-related lymphedema even at a latent stage. <br>	1528	752	10

A theory-driven psycho-educational intervention programme for gynaecological cancer patients during treatment trajectory: a randomised controlled trial.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis study aims to evaluate the effects of a theory-driven psycho-educational intervention programme on uncertainty in illness, anxiety and sexual functioning in a cohort of Chinese patients with gynaecological cancer. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWomen with newly diagnosed gynaecological cancer (n=202) received either a 4-session, 12-week-long, culturally appropriate psycho-educational intervention programme (n=102) or attention from intervener (n=100) in a two-group randomised controlled trial. Patient-reported measures included Chinese version of Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Scale (C-MUIS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - Anxiety subscale and Sexual Function-Vaginal Changes Questionnaire (SVQ). Data regarding uncertainty in illness and anxiety were collected at baseline and post-intervention, while data on sexual functioning were collected post-intervention. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPatients receiving psycho-educational intervention reported significantly greater reductions in ambiguity, inconsistency and overall uncertainty in illness, as measured by C-MUIS (p<.01). They were also more likely to be sexually active (p=.037), report their partners having greater sexual interest (p=.008) and perceive a significantly greater level of intimacy (p=.001) in the SVQ. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGiven the growing population of gynaecological cancer survivors and the universal side effects of the disease and its related treatments, the established design and content of the psycho-educational intervention programme should be incorporated into routine clinical practice. <br>	1334	634	7
Posttraumatic Growth and Related Factors among 1221 Chinese Cancer Survivors.	<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is an increasing number of studies on the posttraumatic growth (PTG) of cancer survivors worldwide. However, few Chinese studies have reported about PTG in cancer survivors due to the underdevelopment of community health services. This study aimed to evaluate the level of PTG in China and explore related factors among a large sample of survivors of more than 12 cancer types. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe recruited 1236 survivors from 14 sites of the Beijing Cancer Rehabilitation Association. Survivors completed standardized questionnaires assessing PTG, social support, coping styles, demographic characteristics, and clinical conditions. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate potential predictive factors of PTG. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 1221 (98.7%) subjects completed the questionnaires. The average PTG score was 61.15 ± 20.26. Seven variables were included in the final regression model: social support, coping style, time after treatment, exercise, BMI, work status, and economic income (P<0.05). Survivors who had low levels of social support, had negative coping strategies, had a time after treatment of less than five years, exercised irregularly, had an abnormal BMI, were unemployed, or had low economic income had lower PTG levels. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPTG levels among Chinese cancer survivors are associated with social support, coping style, time after treatment, exercise, BMI, work status, and economic income. Strategies tailored to Chinese survivors should be developed to promote their PTG and improve their physical and psychology well-being. <br>	1309	663	11
Full axillary lymph node dissection and increased breast epidermal thickness 1 year after radiation therapy for breast cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe previously reported a prospective study showing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is associated with increased breast skin thickening during and 6 weeks post-radiation therapy (RT), and now report ALND's long-term impact at 1 year. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAmong 66 women who received whole breast RT after lumpectomy, objective ultrasound measurements of epidermal thickness over four quadrants of the treated breast were measured at five time points: before RT, week 6 of RT, and 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year post-RT. Skin thickness ratio (STRA) was generated by normalizing for corresponding measurements of the contralateral breast. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 2,436 ultrasound images were obtained. Among 63 women with evaluable data at 1 year, mean STRA significantly increased at 6 months (absolute mean increase of 65%, SD 0.054), and remained elevated at 1 year post-RT (absolute mean increase of 44%, SD 0.048). In multivariable analysis, ALND compared to sentinel lymph node biopsy, longer interval between surgery and RT, increased baseline STRA, and Caucasian race predicted for more severe changes in STRA at 1 year compared to baseline (all P < .05). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the setting of whole breast RT, our findings suggest that ALND has long-term repercussions on breast skin thickening. <br>	1060	610	7
A comparison of EBV serology and serum cell-free DNA as screening tools for nasopharyngeal cancer: results of the Singapore NPC screening cohort.	We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) screening by comprehensive clinical follow-up and adjunctive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) testing. In a prospective cohort study, 524 individuals with a first-degree family history of NPC were recruited at a university clinical center in Singapore. The cohort was evaluated at baseline and at 6-monthly intervals, with a complete head and neck examination including nasopharyngeal endoscopy. Blood was taken at baseline and at yearly intervals for EBV Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) IgA, EBV Early Antigen (EA) IgA serology and serum cell-free EBV DNA. Nasopharyngeal biopsy was performed when any irregularity in the nasopharynx was observed, or when EBV markers were elevated. The mean duration of follow-up was 57.7 months, with an average of 8.6 clinical visits per participant. Five participants (0.96%) were identified to have NPC, giving a prevalence of 199 per 100,000 person-years of screening. Four of the five NPC cases identified had asymptomatic T1 disease, at an earlier stage compared to NPC patients diagnosed in the clinic during the same time period (p = 0.0297). All NPC cases identified had elevated EBV-EA IgA titres ≥ 1:10, with a specificity of 94.6% and a positive predictive value of 15.2%, outperforming EBV-VCA IgA and serum EBV DNA. Two NPC cases were biopsied only because of elevated EBV serology titres, with increasing EBV-EA IgA titres preceding the diagnosis of NPC. In conclusion, screening for NPC is effective in identifying early stage disease. Adjunctive EBV-EA IgA testing improved the effectiveness of screening. This article is protected by copyright.

Combination of Chinese and Western Medicine to Prevent and Reverse Resistance of Cancer Cells to Anticancer Drugs.	Resistance to anticancer drugs is a major problem in oncology, which causes the failure of antitumor treatment. A variety of factors contribute to drug resistance, including drug efflux and metabolism, tumor cell heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment stress-induced genetic or epigenetic alterations in the cancer cells and so on. However, how to circumvent this resistance to improve anticancer efficacy remains to be determined. To circumvent chemotherapeutic resistance, many reversal agents have been developed, but most of them fail in clinical trials due to severe adverse effects. Recently, several natural products have been reported to augment sensitivity or overcome resistance of anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs, including elemene, curcumin, Shenqi Fuzheng Injection (), PHY906, etc. Thus, understanding the novel function of Chinese medicine may allow us to develop a promising therapeutic approach to enhance the effects of anticancer strategies and prevent or overcome their resistance in the treatment of cancer patients. <br>	898	148	6
"Let Go, Let God": A Qualitative Study Exploring Cancer Patients' Spirituality and Its Place in the Medical Setting.	This study explored the role of God and spirituality in cancer patients to gain deeper insight into how patients use their spirituality to cope during illness, including how they see the medical team meeting their spiritual needs. From our work, some naturally emerging themes included Finding God in Cancer and Healing, Spiritual Support Desired from Medical Community, Doctor as "Gift from God"?, and Communication and the Power of Talk. Cancer patients not only acknowledged a spiritual need, but a desire for it to be addressed by their medical team as part of their treatment. <br>	493	96	3
Cancer Cell Membrane Decorated Silica Nanoparticle Loaded with miR495 and Doxorubicin to Overcome Drug Resistance for Effective Lung Cancer Therapy.	Current cancer therapy usually succumbs to many extracellular and intracellular barriers, among which untargeted distribution and multidrug resistance (MDR) are two important difficulties responsible for poor outcome of many drug delivery systems (DDS). Here, in our study, the dilemma was addressed by developing a cancer cell membrane (CCM)-coated silica (SLI) nanoparticles to co-deliver miR495 with doxorubicin (DOX) for effective therapy of lung cancer (CCM/SLI/R-D). The homologous CCM from MDR lung cancer cells (A549/DOX) was supposed to increase the tumor-homing property of the DDS to bypass the extracellular barriers. Moreover, the MDR of cancer cells were conquered through downregulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression using miR495. It was proved that miR495 could significantly decrease the expression of P-gp which elevated intracellular drug accumulation in A549/DOX. The in vitro and in vivo results exhibited that CCM/SLI/R-D showed a greatly enhanced therapeutic effect on A549/DOX, which was superior than applying miR495 or DOX alone. The preferable effect of CCM/SLI/R-D on conquering the MDR in lung cancer provides a novel alternative for effective chemotherapy of MDR cancers. <br>	1041	192	6
Exploring health behaviors, quality of life, and support needs in African-American prostate cancer survivors: a pilot study to support future interventions.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspProstate cancer incidence and mortality rates are highest among African-American men. Comorbidity burden and quality of life (QOL) challenges are also high. Many factors drive these differences; health behaviors are important modifiable contributors. Studies document positive results for lifestyle interventions targeting NHW prostate cancer survivors, but inclusion of African-Americans is limited. We conducted an exploratory mixed-methods study with AAPCS to inform the development of a culturally relevant lifestyle intervention. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwenty-two AAPCS completed questionnaires and a discussion group on dietary and physical activity patterns, QOL, and unmet needs related to lifestyle changes. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeventy-five percent of the participants were overweight or obese, 82% had physical activity patterns considered insufficiently active and only 10% did resistance training at least twice weekly in accordance with current survivorship guidelines. Diets were high in saturated fat and sugar, low in fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake. PROMIS-29 scores indicated that AAPCS had worse physical functioning, pain interference, and sexual functioning, but less social isolation compared to the general population. Compared to other prostate cancer survivors, participants reported poorer status on all domains. Qualitative data highlighted barriers to healthy lifestyles including access, knowledge, and skills, as well as motivators including health benefits and building strength to feel more "manly." Participants shared high interest in programs to exercise, learn about affordable healthy eating, and bring survivors together to discuss survivorship issues. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLifestyle interventions targeting AAPCS are warranted. To increase impact of these efforts, consideration of environmental, cultural, and survivor contexts will be key. <br>	1580	729	13
Moving forward after cancer: successful implementation of a colorectal cancer patient-centered transitions program.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCancer survivors transitioning between academic comprehensive cancer systems and community general practice settings are vulnerable to discontinuity, inconsistency and variation in care, inappropriate surveillance testing, and a sense of isolation and loss. Though these issues have been well recognized for over a decade and a half in the survivorship, oncologic, and health services literature, there remains a dearth of positive examples of models that have been well received by both the transitioned patient and the providers on either side of the handoff. We herein describe a sustained positive example of a transitions program. This program centers on standardized and personalized survivorship care plans (SCP) to guide follow-up care and recovery. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFollowing the province-wide introduction of a transitions program for treated stages II and III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, a post-implementation survey was mailed to transitioned patients with the primary outcome evaluated the patients' perception of improved continuity of care and the main instrument used the Patient Continuity of Care Questionnaire. This was compared against a previously published pre-implementation historical control. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe data presented comparing pre- and post-implementation patient cohorts reflect significantly improved patient-reported perceptions regarding the enhanced continuity and coordination of their follow-up and survivorship care after the province-wide introduction of a formal transitions process. This SCP intervention has been sustained post implementation. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing, as a starting-point, a standardized electronically SCP, CancerCare Manitoba has successfully facilitated a jurisdiction-wide implementation of a scalable, reproducible, and adaptable transitions program. <br><b>IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis intervention at the time of transition back to the community has enhanced CRC survivor perception of continuity and coordination of follow-up care. <br>	1674	1152	10
I.CAN: health coaching provides tailored nutrition and physical activity guidance to people diagnosed with cancer in a rural region in West Gippsland, Australia.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI.CAN is a program which uses health coaching to provide tailored nutrition and physical activity guidance to people diagnosed with cancer in a rural region in eastern Victoria, Australia. I.CAN builds patients' nutritional knowledge, attitudes and health literacy to healthy eating and weight maintenance and incorporates sustainable and affordable dietary changes into everyday eating patterns. While oncology care identifies patients at risk of malnutrition and weight loss, less attention has been placed on building patient's capacity for healthy lifestyles and behaviours after cancer treatment. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI.CAN is delivered by a dietitian and exercise physiologist and is offered in three streams, one-on-one consultation, one-one-one and group and group. Paired t tests and chi-square analysis were used to analyse data. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt 3-month review, I.CAN participants (1) significantly increased exercise activity from 51 to 86% (p < 0.001) and (2) showed increased trends in positive food choices from 62 to 66%. Importantly, positive food choices for alcohol and processed snacks were maintained, and there were increases in positive food choices for fresh fruit and vegetables, low fat dairy and processed meats. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI.CAN is an example of a program which can be delivered within a rural setting, with minimal resources, and achieve positive impact for patients. <br><b>IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKey to the success of the program is promoting wellness early in the cancer trajectory and providing patients with practical tools, a person-centred and multidisciplinary team approach and a program which is adaptable to the changing needs of the patient and the health service. <br>	1390	1000	9
The comparison between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in lung cancer patients.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are several studies comparing the difference between adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of lung cancer. However, seldom studies compare the different overall survival (OS) between AC and SqCC at same clinical or pathological stage. The aim of the study was to investigate the 5-year OS between AC and SqCC groups. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspData were obtained from the Taiwan Society of Cancer Registry. There were 48,296 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients analyzed between 2009 and 2014 in this retrospective study. We analyzed both the AC and SqCC groups by age, gender, smoking status, Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI) score, clinical TNM stage, pathological stage, tumor location, histologic grade, pleura invasion, performance status, treatment, stage-specific 5-year OS rate in each clinical stage I-IV and causes of death. We used propensity score matching to reduce the bias. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe AC and SqCC groups are significantly different in age, gender, smoking status, CCI score, clinical TNM stage, pathological stage, tumor location, histologic grade, pleura invasion, performance status, treatment, stage-specific 5-year OS rate in each clinical stage and causes of death (p < 0.0001). The stage-specific 5-year OS rates between AC and SqCC were 79% vs. 47% in stage I; 50% vs. 32% in stage II; 27% vs. 13% in stage III; 6% vs. 2% in stage IV, respectively (all p values < 0.0001). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAC and SqCC have significantly different outcomes in lung cancer. We suggest that these two different cancers should be analyzed separately to provide more precise outcomes in the future. <br>	1336	769	15
Psychometric validation of the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS-12): a prospective cohort study.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS) is a questionnaire to evaluate the aesthetic and functional outcome after breast conserving surgery (BCS). The original BCTOS with its 22 items on three subscales was refined to a shorter, improved, and easier to administer patient-reported outcome measure, the BCTOS-12. The BCTOS-12 consists of 12 items on two distinct subscales, the Functional Status and the Aesthetic Status. The aim of this study was to validate the BCTOS-12 in a prospective cohort. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor this study, 239 breast cancer patients were included preoperatively, and 204 patients completed the BCTOS-12 and EORTC QLQ C30 BR23 shortly after their BCS, corresponding to a follow-up rate of 85%. The item-factor structure was examined by confirmatory factor analysis. The reliability was calculated by McDonald's Omega for estimating internal consistency. The convergent validity was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between the related scales of the questionnaires. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe BCTOS-12 showed a robust item-factor structure and a good internal consistency with McDonald's Omega of 0.89 for the Aesthetic Status and 0.90 for the Functional Status. A high convergent and divergent validity was indicated by correlations between the subscales of the EORTC QLQ C30 BR23 and the BCTOS-12. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOverall, the results demonstrate a successful psychometric validation of the BCTOS-12. The BCTOS-12 is a refined, improved, and now validated, instrument. It can be used in clinical studies and routine management for the evaluation of the aesthetic and functional outcome after BCS. <br>	1361	788	10
[Adjuvant and inductive systemic treatment in non-small cell lung cancer].	A large number of randomized trials have demonstrated an undoubted advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy in comparison to surgery alone. This is true for all lymph node positive cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a tumor size of 4 cm or more. Worldwide, the application of adjuvant chemotherapy for these indications is regarded as standard treatment. Due to the positive results of adjuvant chemotherapy, nearly all studies focusing on neoadjuvant chemotherapy were stopped early because control arms with surgery alone were no longer regarded as ethically justified; however, in meta-analyses the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy seems be as strong as the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy. In clinical practice neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not routinely established in early stage disease. This approach is more often applied in advanced stages, such as N2 lymph node involvement or in patients where the tumor most probably requires pneumectomy for resection. In the last decade the options for systemic treatment of NSCLC have dramatically changed. In addition to chemotherapy, targeted treatment of patients with molecularly altered tumors and immunotherapy have been used very successfully in advanced stages. The options might also have a high impact on survival in early stages and the integration of these treatment modalities in the management of early stage disease is warranted. This article summarizes the established and new options in additive systemic treatment and presents the current state of treatment. <br>	1309	234	10
Postoperative Radiotherapy for Resected Stage IIIA-N2 Non-small-cell Lung Cancer: A Population-Based Time-Trend Study.	<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe value of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) for resected stage IIIA-N2 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is controversial with few studies focusing on whether PORT always plays a part in clinical practice and generates benefits to patients across different time periods. We investigated this issue using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Database (SEER) and assessed the temporal trends spanning 27 years. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWithin SEER, we selected stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC patients who underwent a lobectomy or pneumonectomy and coded as receiving PORT or never receiving radiotherapy over three time periods: 1988 to 1996, 1997 to 2005, 2006 to 2014. For each period, survival analyses were performed and propensity score matching (PSM) was used in the potentially beneficial subgroup. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp45.4% of 5568 eligible patients received PORT. The yearly PORT use rates varied largely from 27.8% to 74.4%. Overall survival (OS) was distinctly improved over the period. The application of PORT had a significant impact on survival only in period 1 and 3. In subgroup analysis, the OS benefit of PORT was significant in each period in patients with 50% or more lymph node ratio (LNR) both before (hazard ratios, and P values of 0.647, P = .002; 0.804, P = .008; 0.721, P < .001 for period 1, 2, 3, respectively) and after PSM (0.642, P = .006; 0.785, P = .004; 0.748, P = .003 for period 1, 2, 3, respectively). <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe benefits of PORT are lasting and stable throughout the years in patients with LNR of 50% or more. This might provide a clue on proper patient selection for PORT application. <br>	1319	767	10
The Effects of Health Disparities on Perceptions About Lung Cancer Screening (LCS): Survey Results of a Patient Sample.	Lung cancer screening (LCS) is currently advocated in a subset of current or former smokers with a thirty pack-year smoking history or higher. Studies report that few patients meeting the criteria for screening are undergoing LCS. We conducted a survey to assess if barriers to LCS (race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status) affect the perceptions about LCS that could influence screening uptake. We did not detect different perceptions based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status; however, our survey found that fewer barriers and more benefits to LCS may be perceived in patients who undergo other types of health screening and more benefits for those with internet capable devices. <br>	590	110	4
Characterization and outcomes of patients enrolled to multiple phase I cancer trials.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSome patients who participate in early phase cancer trials enroll to more than one trial. Whether these patients have different characteristics or outcomes than patients who enroll to a single phase I trial is unknown. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe study included all patients who participated in the solid tumor drug development program of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, a specialized academic cancer center, from July 2014 to January 2017. Patients sequentially enrolled to multiple phase I trials were compared to those enrolled in a single trial according to demographics, clinical characteristics, reported toxicities and prognosis. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe study cohort included 328 patients, including 61 (19%) enrolled to multiple phase I trials and 267 (81%) enrolled to a single phase I trial. Demographics, comorbidities, performance status, cancer site and time between initial diagnosis and initial enrollment to the phase I program were comparable between both groups. Patients enrolled to multiple phase I trials received more previous non-trial treatment lines (median 3 versus 2, p < 0.001) and had a higher average response rate on phase I trials (18% versus 10%, p = 0.03). Toxicity data, including number of any adverse events (AEs), grade 3/4 AEs, serious AEs and dose-limiting toxicities were comparable between both groups. Time to disease progression and time to last documented follow-up were also comparable between both groups. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPatients enrolled to multiple phase I trials and those enrolled to a single trial had similar toxicity and prognostic profiles. These patients do not introduce bias into early-phase cancer trials results. <br>	1376	683	10

A nutrient-wide association study for risk of prostate cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition and the Netherlands Cohort Study.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe evidence from the literature regarding the association of dietary factors and risk of prostate cancer is inconclusive. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA nutrient-wide association study was conducted to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the associations between 92 foods or nutrients and risk of prostate cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for total energy intake, smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, diabetes and education were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for standardized dietary intakes. As in genome-wide association studies, correction for multiple comparisons was applied using the false discovery rate (FDR < 5%) method and suggested results were replicated in an independent cohort, the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS). <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 5916 and 3842 incident cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed during a mean follow-up of 14 and 20 years in EPIC and NLCS, respectively. None of the dietary factors was associated with the risk of total prostate cancer in EPIC (minimum FDR-corrected P, 0.37). Null associations were also observed by disease stage, grade and fatality, except for positive associations observed for intake of dry cakes/biscuits with low-grade and butter with aggressive prostate cancer, respectively, out of which the intake of dry cakes/biscuits was replicated in the NLCS. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur findings provide little support for an association for the majority of the 92 examined dietary factors and risk of prostate cancer. The association of dry cakes/biscuits with low-grade prostate cancer warrants further replication given the scarcity in the literature. <br>	1452	696	9
[Predictive biomarkers in bladder cancer].	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the last few years, significant progress has been achieved in the therapeutic options for advanced urothelial bladder cancer. <br><b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of this work was to give an overview of the status and future perspective of the therapeutic options in this setting. Its focus is on the discussion of tissue-based therapy-predictive markers, which are evaluated through (molecular) pathology and thereby strengthening the role of pathology itself. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCurrent (clinical study) data, the literature, and our own expertise were considered and summarized in the areas of therapy prediction of platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and other therapeutic approaches. <br><b>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMolecular subtypes exhibit a predictive value both in platinum-based chemotherapy as well as in immunotherapy. However, further work is required to elucidate the predictive role of molecular subtypes in both settings. Changes in the DNA damage repair enzyme (DDR) genes, ERCC2, and ERBB2 as well as differences in the expression of EMMPRIN, survivin, and HMGA2 show promising results as further markers of chemotherapy efficacy. In the prediction of immunotherapy success, this mainly relates to the evaluation of the tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor neoantigen burden (TNB), APOBEC signatures (MSig1; 3A/3B), and CD8-positive T‑effector cell signature. When using the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor erdafitinib, which has not yet been approved in Germany, the evaluation of specific FGFR mutations and/or gene fusions by a companion diagnostic test is mandatory in the USA. <br>	1327	508	9
[Urachal Cancer: an update of current molecular findings].	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUrachal cancer is a rare type of cancer, often following a clinically aggressive course. Due to its rarity, knowledge about its molecular background is still limited. In addition, no sufficiently reliable diagnostic markers are available. <br><b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of the present study is to give an overview of our recent molecular projects on urachal cancer and to connect it with current literature in the field. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThree projects are introduced. The first project identified and validated diagnostic biomarkers in urachal adenocarcinomas compared to colorectal adenocarcinomas and primary adenocarcinomas of the bladder using various proteomic methods. In the second project, the most relevant differential diagnostic markers between urachal adenocarcinomas and colorectal adenocarcinomas compared to normal tissue (urachal remnants) were determined by analyzing a miRNA panel. Sequence analyses were performed in the third project. The focus was on molecular differences to colorectal adenocarcinomas and urothelial carcinomas. <br><b>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe detected potential biomarker candidates for the immunohistochemical differential-diagnosis and generated a miRNA-based diagnostic scoring system with a potentially high differential-diagnostic significance. The sequence analyses data confirm the molecular autonomy of the urachal adenocarcinomas compared to other entities. <br>	1163	514	11
Disparities in the use of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of lung cancer brain metastases: a SEER-Medicare study.	Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a costly procedure used to irradiate disease tissue while sparing healthy tissue, ideally limiting the side effects of treatment. SRS is frequently used in the setting of lung cancer, which is associated with greater rates of BM, though its cost may lead to potentially inequitable use across patient populations. This study investigates potential disparities in the use of SRS to treat Medicare patients. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results cancer registry data for patients diagnosed between the years 2010 and 2012 were examined to identify lung cancer patients diagnosed with BM at the same time as their primary cancer (SBM). Medicare claims for SRS were identified; the odds of having SRS claims and hazards of mortality associated with those odds were examined with respect to various clinical and demographic characteristics. Of 74,142 Medicare-enrolled patients diagnosed with lung cancer, 9192 were diagnosed with SBM and 3259 of those patients received SRS. Adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics, males with SBM had 0.85 times the odds of SRS compared to females with SBM. Black patients and those of other race had significantly lower odds of evidence of SRS compared to WNH patients. SRS may not be delivered equitably among Medicare patients. Males and minority patients may have decreased odds of SRS and worse survival compared to female and WNH patients, respectively. <br>	1230	227	10
KISS1 in breast Cancer progression and autophagy.	Tumor suppressors are cellular proteins typically expressed in normal (non-cancer) cells that not only regulate such cellular functions as proliferation, migration and adhesion, but can also be secreted into extracellular space and serve as biomarkers for pathological conditions or tumor progression. KISS1, a precursor for several shorter peptides, known as metastin (Kisspeptin-54), Kisspeptin-14, Kisspeptin-13 and Kisspeptin-10, is one of those metastasis suppressor proteins, whose expression is commonly downregulated in the metastatic tumors of various origins. The commonly accepted role of KISS1 in metastatic tumor progression mechanism is the ability of this protein to suppress colonization of disseminated cancer cells in distant organs critical for the formation of the secondary tumor foci. Besides, recent evidence suggests involvement of KISS1 in the mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis, autophagy and apoptosis regulation, suggesting a possible role in both restricting and promoting cancer cell invasion. Here, we discuss the role of KISS1 in regulating metastases, the link between KISS1 expression and the autophagy-related biology of cancer cells and the perspectives of using KISS1 as a potential diagnostic marker for cancer progression as well as a new anti-cancer therapeutics. <br>	1124	192	5
A case of portal venous gas after obstructive transverse colon cancer surgery.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPortal venous gas has traditionally been considered an inevitable harbinger of death due to its association with bowel necrosis. Recently, an increasing number of cases of portal venous gas have been reported in patients with various clinical conditions and without bowel necrosis. We herein report the case of a patient in whom portal venous gas developed after transverse colon cancer surgery. <br><b>CASE PRESENTATION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA 69-year-old man who had transverse colon cancer underwent insertion of a transanal ileus tube for decompression. Transverse colon resection was performed on the 11th day after the insertion of the transanal ileus tube. The patient had a high fever on the 6th day after the operation. Computed tomography showed portal venous gas over the entire area of the liver and pneumatosis intestinalis in the wall of the ascending colon. There were no signs of anastomotic leakage or bowel necrosis, so we decided to use conservative therapy with fasting and antibiotics. The portal venous gas disappeared on the 19th day after the operation. The patient was discharged in good condition on the 29th day after the operation. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspConservative treatment for portal venous gas is reasonable for patients without signs of anastomotic leakage or bowel necrosis. However, it is important to carefully observe patients with portal venous gas during conservative treatment because portal venous gas may be life-threatening. <br>	1185	515	12
Blood levels of endocrine-disrupting metals and prevalent breast cancer among US women.	A growing body of evidence has pointed to a role of environmental chemical exposures in breast cancer etiology. This study was to examine the association between exposure to the endocrine-disrupting metals, including cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg), and breast cancer in US women. A nationally representative subsample of 9260 women aged ≥ 20 years in the 2003-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was analyzed for the association of blood levels of these metals with prevalent breast cancer using multivariate logistic regression models. Of the study participants, 284 women (weighted prevalence, 2.8%) were self-reported being diagnosed with breast cancer during 2003-2012. Breast cancer women showed significantly elevated blood levels of Cd and Pb, but not Hg. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that women in all of the higher quartiles of blood lead levels (BLLs) had significantly increased odds ratio of prevalent breast cancer compared with those in the lowest quartile. However, a significant association with prevalent breast cancer was not seen with blood levels of either Cd or Hg. Our study demonstrates a potential relationship between lead exposure, measured as BLLs, and female breast cancer. Additional epidemiologic and mechanistic studies would further explore these interactions and elucidate the potential role of lead exposure in breast cancer etiology. <br>	1215	217	8
Mechanism of anchorage-independency and tumor formation of cancer cells: possible involvement of cell membrane-bound laminin-332.	Cancer cells are characterized by anchorage-independency and tumor formation. Involvement of laminin-332 in the pathogenesis of cancer has also been reported. I present a theory that can explain these characteristics together. Proliferating keratinocytes in wound healing produce and deposit laminin-332, which is shown in the provisional basement membrane of a wound. In association with wound closure, expression of LG4/5 domain on the α3 chain of laminin-332 disappears, implicating cleavage of LG4/5 domain. LG4/5 domain expression indicates that laminin-332 prior to the cleavage is bound to the cell membrane, because LG4/5 domain is a cell binding site. In this binding, heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the cell surface seems to be the acceptor for LG4/5 domain. I named this laminin "cell membrane-bound laminin-332" (ML332). ML332 would then bind to integrin α3β1 via LG1-3 domain, the integrin binding site, and activate FAK and the following Ras/MAPK pathway. Therefore, ML332 eliminates the need for proliferating keratinocytes to bind to processed laminin-332 secreted and deposited into the basement membrane for their proliferation (anchorage-independency). This may hold true of every proliferating epithelial cell, either benign or malignant. Whereas wound closure deprives keratinocytes of anchorage-independency, such events do not occur in cancer cells, and cancer cells maintain anchorage-independency. In the basement membrane formation by epithelial cells, short arms of laminin-332 anchored to the cell membrane bind each other and generate a meshwork polymer. This is the three-arm interaction model. In a similar manner, short-arm interactions between adjacent cancer cells may occur and induce tumor formation. <br>	1495	271	15

Downregulation of LncRNA GAS5 promotes liver cancer proliferation and drug resistance by decreasing PTEN expression.	Accumulating evidence has shown that the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and drug resistance. In this study, we aimed to investigate the biological function roles of lncRNAs growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) and its underlying molecular mechanism in the development of HCC. qRT-PCR was used to detect GAS5, miR-21, and PTEN levels. MTT, cell counting assays, and xenograft mouse model were applied to measure cell proliferation rate in vitro and in vivo. The luciferase reporter assay and RNA immune-precipitation assay were introduced to evaluate the relationship between GAS5 and miR-21. We found that GAS5 was downregulated in HCC cell lines and tumor tissues. Knockdown of GAS5 enhanced HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and increased HCC cell resistance to doxorubicin. GAS5 acted as a sponge for miR-21 silencing and consequently led to the elevation of PTEN expression. Our data demonstrated that GAS5 functioned as a tumor suppressor role in HCC through regulation of miR-21-PTEN singling pathways, suggesting a potential application of GAS5 in HCC therapy. <br>	984	187	8
[89Zr]Zr-cetuximab PET/CT as biomarker for cetuximab monotherapy in patients with RAS wild-type advanced colorectal cancer.	<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne-third of patients with RAS wild-type mCRC do not benefit from anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. This might be a result of variable pharmacokinetics and insufficient tumor targeting. We evaluated cetuximab tumor accumulation on [89Zr]Zr-cetuximab PET/CT as a potential predictive biomarker and determinant for an escalating dosing strategy. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPET/CT imaging of [89Zr]Zr-cetuximab (37 MBq/10 mg) after a therapeutic pre-dose (500 mg/m2 ≤ 2 h) cetuximab was performed at the start of treatment. Patients without visual tumor uptake underwent dose escalation and a subsequent [89Zr]Zr-cetuximab PET/CT. Treatment benefit was defined as stable disease or response on CT scan evaluation after 8 weeks. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVisual tumor uptake on [89Zr]Zr-cetuximab PET/CT was observed in 66% of 35 patients. There was no relationship between PET positivity and treatment benefit (52% versus 80% for PET-negative, P = 0.16), progression-free survival (3.6 versus 5.7 months, P = 0.15), or overall survival (7.1 versus 9.4 months, P = 0.29). However, in 67% of PET-negative patients, cetuximab dose escalation (750-1250 mg/m2) was applied, potentially influencing outcome in this group. None of the second [89Zr]Zr-cetuximab PET/CT was positive. Eighty percent of patients without visual tumor uptake had treatment benefit, making [89Zr]Zr-cetuximab PET/CT unsuitable as a predictive biomarker. Tumor SUVpeak did not correlate to changes in tumor size on CT (P = 0.23), treatment benefit, nor progression-free survival. Cetuximab pharmacokinetics were not related to treatment benefit. BRAF mutations, right-sidedness, and low sEGFR were correlated with intrinsic resistance to cetuximab. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTumor uptake on [89Zr]Zr-cetuximab PET/CT failed to predict treatment benefit in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC receiving cetuximab monotherapy. BRAF mutations, right-sidedness, and low sEGFR correlated with intrinsic resistance to cetuximab. <br>	1643	831	16
[Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based diagnostics and treatment of prostate cancer].	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSince their clinical introduction in 2011, PSMA-PET/CT (PSMA: prostate-specific membrane antigen) as well as PSMA therapy of prostate cancer (PC) have spread rapidly worldwide. <br><b>OBJECTIVES:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo summarize the current knowledge about both PSMA-PET/CT and PSMA therapy of PC. <br><b>METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe knowledge derived from the literature as well as the authors' experiences were collected in this review. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPSMA-PET/CT demonstrates a very high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of recurrent PC as well as for the primary staging of intermediate- and high-risk PC. PSMA therapy shows promising results in third-line treatment for patients with castration-resistant, metastatic PC. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPSMA-PET/CT is meanwhile established as the gold standard for the detection of recurrent PC and is in the process of assuming the same role for primary staging of intermediate- to high-risk PC. PSMA therapy serves as a promising third-line therapy in an increasing number of centers. <br>	802	511	7
From state-of-the-art treatments to novel therapies for advanced-stage pancreatic cancer.	Improvements in the outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have lagged behind advances made in the treatment of many other malignancies over the past few decades. For most patients with PDAC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. For patients with resectable disease, modified 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) is the standard-of-care adjuvant therapy, although data from several randomized trials have shown improved outcomes with neoadjuvant treatment strategies. For patients with advanced-stage or metastatic disease, comprehensive genomic profiling has revealed several potentially actionable alterations in small subsets of patients and the feasibility of implementing such strategies is beginning to be confirmed. Novel therapies targeting certain aberrations, most notably BRCA1/2 mutations, mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies or NTRK1-3 fusions, have shown considerable activity in clinical trials, and larotrectinib, entrectinib and pembrolizumab have received FDA approval for the treatment of patients with tumours harbouring NTRK fusions and MMR deficiencies, respectively, regardless of primary tumour histology. In this Review, we describe the available data on the activity of these and other agents in patients with PDAC. Our discussion is structured according to the acronym 'PRIME' to organize the various treatment strategies currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials: Pathway inhibition, alteration of DNA Repair pathways, Immunotherapy, cancer Metabolism and targeting the Extracellular tumour microenvironment. <br>	1418	220	7

Hsa_circ_0001361 promotes bladder cancer invasion and metastasis through miR-491-5p/MMP9 axis.	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been increasingly indicated to be important participants in the development and progression of various malignant tumors. Our previous studies found that hundreds of circRNAs were aberrantly expressed in bladder cancer (BC) by high-throughput sequencing and we have confirmed that the downregulated circRNAs circHIPK3, circRNA BCRC-3, and circNR3C1 played inhibitory roles in BC progression. In this study, we focused on the upregulated circRNAs and identified a novel circular RNA, hsa_circ_0001361 (circ0001361), was expressed at high levels in BC tissues and cell lines based on RNA-Seq data and qRT-PCR analysis, and it was positively corelated with pathologic grade and muscle invasion. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis implied that BC patients with high circ0001361 expression level had a poor overall survival. Functionally, circ0001361 promoted BC cell invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, but had no effect on cell cycle and proliferation. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing analysis indicated that MMP9 was upregulated in circ0001361-overexpressed BC cells, and MMP9 was verified to mediate circ0001361-induced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that circ0001361 could directly interact with miR-491-5p to upregulate MMP9 expression. Collectively, our findings indicate that circ0001361 plays oncogenic role in BC invasion and metastasis through targeting the miR-491-5p/MMP9 axis, and it might be a potential novel target for BC therapy. <br>	1313	226	8
MCP-1/CCR-2 axis in adipocytes and cancer cell respectively facilitates ovarian cancer peritoneal metastasis.	Ovarian cancer selective metastasizes to the omentum contributing to the poor prognosis associated with ovarian cancer. However, the mechanism underlining this propensity and therapeutic approaches to counter this process has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that MCP-1 produced by omental adipocytes binding to its cognate receptor CCR-2 on ovarian cancer cells facilitates migration and omental metastasis by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and its downstream effectors HIF-1α and VEGF-A in cell lines, xenografts, and transgenic murine models. MCP-1 antibody significantly decreased tumor burden and increased survival of mice in vivo. Interestingly, metformin decreased omental metastasis at least partially by inhibiting MCP-1 secretion from adipocytes independent of direct effects on cancer cells. Together this suggests a novel target of MCP-1/CCR-2 axis that could benefit ovarian cancer patients. <br>	798	140	6

Visualization of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in an inflammatory microenvironment-colorectal cancer network.	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process by which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics. In malignant tumors, EMT is crucial for acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype with invasive and metastatic properties, leading to tumor progression. An inflammatory microenvironment is thought to be responsible for the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the precise role of inflammatory microenvironments in EMT-related CRC progression remains unclear. Here, we show the spatiotemporal visualization of CRC cells undergoing EMT using a fluorescence-guided EMT imaging system in which the mesenchymal vimentin promoter drives red fluorescent protein (RFP) expression. An inflammatory microenvironment including TNF-α, IL-1β, and cytokine-secreting inflammatory macrophages induced RFP expression in association with the EMT phenotype in CRC cells. In vivo experiments further demonstrated the distribution of RFP-positive CRC cells in rectal and metastatic tumors. Our data suggest that the EMT imaging system described here is a powerful tool for monitoring EMT in inflammatory microenvironment-CRC networks. <br>	1019	163	7
Gastric cancer depends on aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 for fatty acid oxidation.	The major source of ATP in cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we examined energy metabolism in gastric cancer cells and found increased fatty acid oxidation and increased expression of ALDH3A1. Metabolic analysis showed that lipid peroxidation by reactive oxygen species led to spontaneous production of 4-hydroxynonenal, which was converted to fatty acids with NADH production by ALDH3A1, resulting in further fatty acid oxidation. Inhibition of ALDH3A1 by knock down using siRNA of ALDH3A1 resulted in significantly reduced ATP production by cancer cells, leading to apoptosis. Oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondria in gastric cancer cells was driven by NADH supplied via fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, blockade of ALDH3A1 together with mitochondrial complex I using gossypol and phenformin led to significant therapeutic effects in a preclinical gastric cancer model. <br>	757	129	6
Reduced RhoA expression enhances breast cancer metastasis with a concomitant increase in CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokines signaling.	The role of RhoA GTPases in breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis is unclear. Early studies within which mutations in RhoA were designed based on cancer-associated mutations in Ras supported an oncogene role for RhoA. However, recent whole-genome sequencing studies of cancers raised the possibility that RhoA may have a tumor suppression function. Here, using a syngeneic triple negative breast cancer murine model we investigated the physiological effects of reduced RhoA expression on breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis. RhoA knockdown had no effect on primary tumor formation and tumor proliferation, concurring with our in vitro findings where reduced RhoA had no effect on breast cancer cell proliferation and clonogenic growth. In contrast, primary tumors with RhoA knockdown efficiently invaded sentinel lymph nodes and significantly metastasized to lungs compared to control tumors. Mechanistically, the current study demonstrated that this is achieved by promoting a pro-tumor microenvironment, with increased cancer-associated fibroblasts and macrophage infiltration, and by modulating the CCL5-CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axes in the primary tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first such mechanistic study in breast cancer showing the ability of RhoA to suppress chemokine receptor expression in breast tumor cells. Our work suggests a physiological lung and lymph node metastasis suppressor role for RhoA GTPase in breast cancer. <br>	1258	217	9
Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Patients with Breast Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Provides Early Prediction of Pathological Response - A Prospective Study.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) for early prediction of pathological response in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). This prospective unicentric study evaluated 62 patients who underwent NCT. MRI was performed prior to the start of treatment (MR1), after the first NCT cycle (MR2), and upon completion of NCT (MR3). Pathological response was used as the gold-standard. Patients' median age was 45.5 years and the median tumor size was 40 mm. Twenty-four (38.7%) tumors presented complete pathological response (pCR). The percent increase in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value between MR1 and MR2 was higher in the pCR group (p < 0.001). When the minimum increase in ADC between MR1 and MR2 was set at 25%, sensitivity was 83%, specificity was 84%, positive predictive value was 77%, negative predictive value was 89%, and accuracy was 84% for an early prediction of pCR to NCT. Meanwhile, there were no significant changes in major tumor dimensions between MR1 and MR2. In conclusion, an increase in ADC after the first cycle of NCT correlates well with pCR after the chemotherapy in our cohort, precedes reduction in tumor size on conventional MRI, and may therefore be used as an early predictor of treatment response. <br>	1134	219	10
Cell proliferation and invasion are regulated differently by EGFR and MRP1 in T-DM1-resistant breast cancer cells.	We recently reported that T-DM1-resistant JIMT1 (T-DM1R-JIMT1) cells exhibited high invasive activity via EGFR and integrin cooperated pathways and gained cross-resistance to doxorubicin. Here, we show that EGFR positively coordinates with MRP1 in T-DM1R-JIMT1 cells to contribute to cross-resistance to doxorubicin. Downregulating EGFR and MRP1 inhibits T-DM1R-JIMT1 cell growth and re-sensitizes T-DM1R cells to doxorubicin, suggesting that dual targeting EGFR and MRP1 could serve as a therapeutic approach to overcome T-DM1 resistance. However, it increases cell invasion activity of T-DM1R-JIMT1 cells with molecular and cellular phenotypes similar to the breast cancer cells that express low levels of HER2 (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells). Importantly, the invasion activity of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells is also significantly increased after chronically exposed to T-DM1 although cell growth of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells is not inhibited by T-DM1. These results highlight the importance of HER2 heterogenicity in HER-positive breast cancers treated with T-DM1. Our study also provides evidence demonstrating that proliferation and invasion activities of T-DM1R-JIMT1, and MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells are regulated by different mechanisms and that different aspects of cancer cell behaviors affected by targeted-therapeutics should be fully characterized in order to overcome T-DM1-resistant disease and to prevent cancer metastasis. <br>	1249	235	7
Mutation of the PTCH1 gene predicts recurrence of breast cancer.	Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and some patients develop recurrence after standard therapy. Effective predictors are urgently needed to detect recurrence earlier. The activation of Hedgehog signaling in breast cancer is correlated with poor prognosis. PTCH1 is an essential membrane receptor of Hedgehog. However, there are few reports about mutations in Hedgehog genes in breast cancer. We conducted a comprehensive study via an experimental and bioinformatics approach to detect mutated genes in breast cancer. Twenty-two breast cancer patients who developed recurrence within 24 months postoperatively were enrolled with 22 control cancer patients. Targeted deep sequencing was performed to assess the mutations among individuals with breast cancer using a panel of 143 cancer-associated genes. Bioinformatics and public databases were used to predict the protein functions of the mutated genes. Mutations were identified in 44 breast cancer specimens, and the most frequently mutated genes were BRCA2, APC, ATM, BRCA1, NF1, TET2, TSC1, TSC2, NOTCH1, MSH2, PTCH1, TP53, PIK3CA, FBXW7, and RB1. Mutation of these genes was correlated with protein phosphorylation and autophosphorylation, such as peptidyl-tyrosine and protein kinase C phosphorylation. Among these highly mutated genes, mutations of PTCH1 were associated with poor prognosis and increased recurrence of breast cancer, especially mutations in exons 22 and 23. The public sequencing data from the COSMIC database were exploited to predict the functions of the mutations. Our findings suggest that mutation of PTCH1 is correlated with early recurrence of breast cancer patients and will become a powerful predictor for recurrence of breast cancer. <br>	1485	257	13
CDK2-mediated site-specific phosphorylation of EZH2 drives and maintains triple-negative breast cancer.	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks estrogen receptor α (ERα), progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is closely related to basal-like breast cancer. Previously, we and others report that cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) phosphorylates enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) at T416 (pT416-EZH2). Here, we show that transgenic expression of phospho-mimicking EZH2 mutant EZH2T416D in mammary glands leads to tumors with TNBC phenotype. Coexpression of EZH2T416D in mammary epithelia of HER2/Neu transgenic mice reprograms HER2-driven luminal tumors into basal-like tumors. Pharmacological inhibition of CDK2 or EZH2 allows re-expression of ERα and converts TNBC to luminal ERα-positive, rendering TNBC cells targetable by tamoxifen. Furthermore, the combination of either CDK2 or EZH2 inhibitor with tamoxifen effectively suppresses tumor growth and markedly improves the survival of the mice bearing TNBC tumors, suggesting that the mechanism-based combination therapy may be an alternative approach to treat TNBC. <br>	940	162	6
Stochastic and Heterogeneous Cancer Cell Migration: Experiment and Theory.	Cell migration, an essential process for normal cell development and cancer metastasis, differs from a simple random walk: the mean-square displacement (〈(Δr)2(t)〉) of cells sometimes shows non-Fickian behavior, and the spatiotemporal correlation function (G(r, t)) of cells is often non-Gaussian. We find that this intriguing cell migration should be attributed to heterogeneity in a cell population, even one with a homogeneous genetic background. There are two limiting types of heterogeneity in a cell population: cellular heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. Cellular heterogeneity accounts for the cell-to-cell variation in migration capacity, while temporal heterogeneity arises from the temporal noise in the migration capacity of single cells. We illustrate that both cellular and temporal heterogeneity need to be taken into account simultaneously to elucidate cell migration. We investigate the two-dimensional migration of A549 lung cancer cells using time-lapse microscopy and find that the migration of A549 cells is Fickian but has a non-Gaussian spatiotemporal correlation. We find that when a theoretical model considers both cellular and temporal heterogeneity, the model reproduces all of the anomalous behaviors of cancer cell migration. <br>	1091	190	7

Traditional Chinese Medicine Prolongs Progression-Free Survival and Enhances Therapeutic Effects in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)Treated Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients Harboring EGFR Mutations.	BACKGROUND Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Traditional Chinese Medicine combining EGFR-TKIs in treatment of NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study involved 153 advanced-stage NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations. Patients were divided into a Control group (administered EGFR-TKI, n=61) and an Experimental group (administered Traditional Chinese Medicine combining EGFR and TKI, n=92). Progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated for exon 19 deletion and/or 21 deletion patients. Disease control rate (DCR) was assessed to observe therapeutic effects. Adverse effects, including rashes, diarrhea, ALT/AST increase, dental ulcers, and onychia lateralis, were also evaluated. RESULTS TCM combining EGFR-TKI (90.11%) demonstrated no DCR improvement compared to single EGFR-TKI (83.33%) (p>0.05). Median PFS (mPFS) of TCM combining EGFR-TKI (13 months) was significantly longer compared to that in the single EGFR-TKI group (8.8 months) (p=0.001). For 19DEL mutant NSCLC, the mPFS (11 months) in TCM combining EGFR-TKI was significantly longer compared to single EGFR-TKI (8.5 months) (p=0.007). The mPFS of L858 mutant NSCLC patients in EGFR-TKI combining CTM (14 months) was significantly longer compared to single EGFR-TKI (9.5 months) (p=0.015). TCM combining EGFR-TKI was more inclined to prolong mPFS of NSCLC with exon 21 deletion. TCM combining EGFR-TKI illustrated no additional adverse effects in NSCLC patients (p=0.956). CONCLUSIONS Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine prolonged progression-free survival and enhanced therapeutic effect in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations receiving EGFR-TKI treatment. Meanwhile, adjunctive Chinese medicine combining EGFR-TKI in NSCLC with EGFR mutations caused no adverse effects. <br>	1631	295	15

CoA Synthase (COASY) mediates radiation resistance via PI3K signaling in rectal cancer.	Neoadjuvant radiation is standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Response to radiation is highly variable and directly linked with survival. However, there currently are no validated biomarkers or molecular targets to predict or improve radiation response, which would help develop personalized treatment and ideally targeted therapies. Here, we identified a novel biomarker, coenzyme A synthase (COASY), whose mRNA expression was consistently elevated in radioresistant human rectal cancers. This observation was validated in independent patient cohorts and further confirmed in colorectal cancer cell lines. Importantly, genetic overexpression and knockdown yielded radioresistant and sensitive phenotypes, respectively, in vitro and in vivo. COASY-knockdown xenografts were more vulnerable to radiation, showing delayed tumor growth, decreased proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, COASY protein directly interacted with the PI3K regulatory subunit PI3K-P85α, which increased AKT and mTOR phosphorylation, enhancing cell survival. Furthermore, shRNA COASY knockdown disrupted downstream PI3K pathway activation and also hindered DNA double-strand break repair, which both led to improved radiosensitivity. Collectively, this work reveals for the first time, the biological relevance of COASY as a predictive rectal cancer biomarker for radiation response, and offers mechanistic evidence to support COASY as a potential therapeutic target. <br>	1287	198	10
Differential contributions of pre- and post- EMT tumor cells in breast cancer metastasis.	Metastases are responsible for the majority of breast cancer-associated deaths. The contribution of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the establishment of metastases is still controversial. To obtain in vivo evidence of EMT in metastasis, we established an EMT lineage tracing model (Tri-PyMT), in which tumor cells undergoing EMT would irreversibly switch their fluorescent marker from RFP+ to GFP+ due to mesenchymal-specific Cre expression. Surprisingly, we found that lung metastases were predominantly derived from the epithelial compartment of breast tumors. However, concerns were raised on the fidelity and sensitivity of RFP-to-GFP switch of this model in reporting EMT of metastatic tumor cells. Here, we evaluated Tri-PyMT cells at the single-cell level using single-cell RNA-sequencing, and found that the Tri-PyMT cells exhibited a spectrum of EMT phenotypes, with EMT-related genes concomitantly expressed with the activation of GFP. The fluorescent color switch in these cells precisely marked an unequivocal change in EMT status, defining the pre-EMT and post-EMT compartments within the tumor. Consistently, the pre-EMT cells played dominant roles in metastasis, while the post-EMT cells were supportive in promoting tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Importantly, the post-EMT (GFP+) cells in the Tri-PyMT model were not permanently committed to the mesenchymal phenotype; they were still capable of reverting to the epithelial phenotype and giving rise to secondary tumors, suggesting their persistent EMT plasticity. Our study addressed major concerns with the Tri-PyMT EMT lineage tracing model, which provides us with a powerful tool to investigate the dynamic EMT process in tumor biology. <br>	1483	267	10
Exosomes Produced by Mesenchymal Stem Cells Drive Differentiation of Myeloid Cells into Immunosuppressive M2-Polarized Macrophages in Breast Cancer.	Tumor-associated macrophages are major contributors to malignant progression and resistance to immunotherapy, but the mechanisms governing their differentiation from immature myeloid precursors remain incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that exosomes secreted by human and mouse tumor-educated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) drive accelerated breast cancer progression by inducing differentiation of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells into highly immunosuppressive M2-polarized macrophages at tumor beds. Mechanistically, MSC-derived exosomes but not exosomes from tumor cells contain TGF-β, C1q, and semaphorins, which promote myeloid tolerogenic activity by driving PD-L1 overexpression in both immature myelomonocytic precursors and committed CD206+ macrophages and by inducing differentiation of MHC class II+ macrophages with enhanced l-Arginase activity and IL-10 secretion at tumor beds. Accordingly, administration of tumor-associated murine MSC-derived exosomes accelerates tumor growth by dampening antitumor immunity, and macrophage depletion eliminates exosome-dependent differences in malignant progression. Our results unveil a new role for MSC-derived exosomes in the differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells into macrophages, which governs malignant growth. <br>	1157	175	5
Plasma Levels and Tissue Expression of Selected Cytokines, Metalloproteinases and Tissue Inhibitors in Patients With Cervical Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCytokines, metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) take part in many processes involved in tumor progression and invasion such as degradation of the extracellular matrix, influence on immune cells associated with tumor tissue, and angiogenesis. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the concentration of plasma levels and tissue expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP9, and their tissue inhibitors TIMP1 and TIMP2 in patients with cervical cancer, patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial dysplasia (CIN3) and patients with ectropion. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspConcentration and expression of all tested parameters was measured in serum with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in tissue with immunohistochemistry method. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe epithelial expression of M-CSF and TIMP1 in cancer tissue was much stronger as compared to that in ectropion and CIN3. In the case of MMP2, lack of or weak expression in epithelial cells was observed in all tested groups. Our studies showed statistical differences of tested parameters in tissue expression and in plasma concentrations in patients with cervical cancer, patients with CIN3 and patients with ectropion. Moreover, data revealed positive correlation between plasma level and cervical cancer cell expression of VEGF. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur findings indicate a potential role of all the proteins tested here in cervical cancer diagnosis, especially VEGF. However, further studies will show whether they play a role in the progression of cancerous changes in epithelial tissue of the cervix. <br>	1404	745	9
Short- and Long-term Outcomes of 2-Step Stapled Intracorporeal Versus Extracorporeal Anastomosis in Laparoscopic Colectomy for Colon Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIntracorporeal anastomosis (IA) in laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer is technically difficult, and there is a lack of consensus on the risk of bacterial contamination and cancer cell dissemination. In this study, short- and long-term outcomes of IA were examined. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShort and long-term outcomes of those who underwent IA (n=44) or extracorporeal anastomosis (EA) (n=61) were compared. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIA was better than EA for blood loss, incision length, and first stool. Maximum temperature and C-reactive protein on postoperative day 1 were higher for the IA group. The rate of positive cultures from intraoperative lavage was higher for IA. The rate of positive cultures improved to an equivalent level by replacing mechanical pretreatment with chemical pretreatment. IA and EA were equivalent for the results of ascites cytology from lavage. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith the use of appropriate preoperative treatment, IA takes advantage of the minimally invasive nature of laparoscopic surgery. <br>	823	478	9
Prevalence and Characteristics of Pneumonitis Following Irradiation of Breast Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPneumonitis is a serious complication after radiotherapy of breast cancer. This study aimed to identify its prevalence and potential risk factors. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 606 patients irradiated following breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy were retrospectively analyzed. In patients developing pneumonitis, radiation and clinical parameters were investigated to identify potential risk factors. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEleven patients (1.8%) developed a pneumonitis grade ≥2. Mean doses to the ipsilateral lung were >7 Gy in 5 patients (45%). Of the other patients, 5 had a chronic inflammatory disease. Six patients (55%) had another malignancy (4 previous contralateral breast cancers, 1 previous ovarian and thyroid cancer, 1 synchronous carcinoma-in-situ (pTis) at the contralateral breast). Five patients (45%) received chemotherapy including taxanes and 4 patients (36%) received trastuzumab. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe prevalence of pneumonitis was 1.8%. Potential risk factors included mean radiation dose to ipsilateral lung >7 Gy, systemic treatment with taxanes or trastuzumab, chronic inflammatory disease and history of another malignancy. <br>	951	445	11
The Prognostic Value of G1 Cyclins, p21 and Rb Protein in Patients With Colon Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCyclins D1 and E play different roles in the cell cycle. Cyclin E promotes chromosome instability, whereas cyclin D1 regulates apoptosis of cells. This study evaluated the prognostic significance of G1 cyclins, p21 and pRb in tumor proliferation. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 102 patients with colon cancer were operated on and staged according to TNM. Follow-up was 2 to 68 months (mean 38.3±16.7 months). Expression of cyclin E and D1 were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLevels of cyclin E expression were correlated with cyclin D1 expression (p=0.038), p21 expression (p=0.047), and pRb expression (p=0.004). The 5-year survival rate along with prognosis of patients with advanced stage (III, IV) colon cancer and cyclin D1 positive tumors, were significantly worse (p=0.009). Statistically significant association was observed between tumor proliferative capacity Ki-67, cyclin D1 (p=0.009), pRb (p=0.031) and p21 (p=0.050). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCyclin D1 is highly expressed in advanced stage colon cancer patients, implying a potential prognostic value. <br>	881	535	10
Expression of Kita-Kyushu Lung Cancer Antigen-1 as Detected by a Novel Monoclonal Antibody in Gastric Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKita-Kyushu lung cancer antigen-1 (KK-LC-1) is a known cancer/testis antigen. Our group has previously shown KK-LC-1 gene expression in gastric cancer. However, could not be detected the KK-LC-1 protein due to the lack of an appropriate antibody. Here, we assessed our original monoclonal antibody (Kmab34B3) and, using it, assessed the expression of KK-LC-1 in gastric cancer. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe evaluated an original monoclonal antibody against KK-LC-1 (Kmab34B3), and used this antibody to compare KK-LC-1 protein expression in tumour and non-tumour stomach cells from gastric cancer patients. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKmab34B3 stained testicular germ cells, and tumour cells in nine out of 11 (82%) specimens. In non-tumorous areas, Kmab34B3 stained 13 out of 29 (45%) pyloric gland specimens. Furthermore, Kmab34B3 also stained intestinal metaplasia positive and negative areas. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKmab34B3 was able to detect KK-LC-1 protein within tumour cells and the pyloric gland where the gene has been shown to be expressed. Therefore, it might be an attractive tool for detecting KK-LC-1 expression in precancerous and cancerous stomach cells. <br>	938	583	10
Elevated Expression of EPHA2 Is Associated With Poor Prognosis After Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTherapeutic targeting of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) has proven successful in treating cancer. However, reports about PTKs in treating prostate cancer are few. Elevated expression of the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2 (EPHA2) receptor tyrosine kinase, a transmembrane protein, is associated with poor prognosis of certain cancer types when the enzyme is dephosphorylated. This study investigated whether EPHA2 is useful in predicting the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspData from 241 patients who had undergone total prostatectomy between 2007 and 2011 were used. EPHA2 protein expression was categorized as high or low by two pathologists. The relationship was examined between EPHA2 expression level (high vs. low) and clinicopathological factors including biochemical recurrence. Correlations were examined between EPHA2, low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP), E-cadherin, and Ki-67. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEPHA2 expression was high in 121 (50.2%) and low in 120 (49.8%) patients. A log-rank test revealed early biochemical recurrence in the high-expression group. Gleason score, Ki-67 labeling index, and biochemical recurrence were more frequent in the high-expression group. Furthermore, multivariate analyses revealed that high EPHA2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio=3.62, 95% confidence interval=2.39-5.61). Correlations between EPHA2 and both LMW-PTP and Ki-67 labeling index were positive, whereas EPHA2 and E-cadherin were negatively correlated. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEPHA2 overexpression is predictive of aggressive prostate cancer behavior. EPHA2 may be a powerful prognostic biomarker for decision-making in postoperative follow-up after total prostatectomy, and regarding the need for palliative treatment. Additionally, it may be an important therapeutic target. <br>	1618	785	16
The Levels of Interferon-gamma Release as a Biomarker for Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe present study aimed to prospectively examine the usefulness of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release (IGR) as a biomarker in non-small-cell lung cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment (ICI-Tx). <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIGR was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at four time points: within 14 days before ICI-Tx (T1), and 8±3 (T2), 22±7 (T3), and 43±7 (T4) days after ICI-Tx. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwenty-nine patients were divided into three groups based on IFN-γ levels in the IGR-positive control: Group-1 (n=8) with <10 IU/ml at T1, Group-2 (n=12) with a decrease in IFN-γ levels to <10 IU/ml at T3 and/or T4, and Group-3 (n=9) without changes in IFN-γ levels. Early progression and ICI-induced interstitial pneumonitis were frequently observed in Group-1 and Group-2, respectively. Group-3 exhibited more treatment cycles than the other groups. All three groups showed clear differences in clinical outcomes. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIFN-γ levels could be a biomarker for ICI-Tx. <br>	814	528	7
Results of Tri-Modality Therapy for Rectal Cancer in Elderly Patients.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspElderly cancer patients are more prevalent and require special attention. This study focused on the outcome of elderly (≥65 years) rectal cancer patients treated with tri-modality therapy. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 105 patients receiving neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy and resection for locally advanced rectal cancers were retrospectively evaluated. Nine characteristics were analyzed for loco-regional control (LRC), metastases-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) including tumor location, gender, age, performance status, radiotherapy technique, primary tumor/lymph node categories, downstaging and histological grading. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe 5-year rates of LRC, MFS and OS were 91%, 78% and 87%, respectively. Radio-chemotherapy was not completed in 12 patients (11%) due to toxicity; 18 patients (17%) experienced grade 3 toxicities. A total of 29 patients (28%) had surgical complications. On multivariate analyses, MFS was significantly associated with downstaging (p=0.003) and OS with lower histological grade (p=0.013). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTri-modality therapy resulted in promising outcomes and was tolerated reasonably well by elderly patients. Prognostic factors were identified that may help personalize future treatment. <br>	1039	521	10
Is D2 Lymphadenectomy Essential for Cytology-positive Gastric Cancer? A Retrospective Analysis.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe appropriate extent of lymphadenectomy on gastric cancer patients with positive peritoneal cytology (CY1) is uncertain. This study retrospectively compared overall survival (OS) after standard and limited lymphadenectomy. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe medical records from four institutions from 2004 to 2018 were reviewed and data for 91 patients with CY1, but no other distant metastases, who underwent gastrectomy were analyzed. D2 or greater lymphadenectomy and less than D2 lymphadenectomy were performed in 51 and 40 patients, respectively. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFull cohort analyses showed that patients who underwent D2 or greater lymphadenectomy had better prognostic nutritional indices and more such patients received postoperative chemotherapy. The OS in the group treated with D2 or greater lymphadenectomy was also significantly better (p=0.045). Twenty-seven pairs of patients were generated via propensity score matching, and analysis of their OS showed no significant difference between the groups according to lymphadenectomy (p=0.61). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe extent of lymphadenectomy may not affect the prognoses for patients with CY1 gastric cancer. <br>	955	497	8
The Value of CA19-9 After Irreversible Electroporation for Pancreatic Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCarbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is an experimental treatment modality for pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether percutaneous IRE lowers the CA19-9 level in pancreatic cancer and whether this correlates with improved overall survival. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeventy-one patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer or local recurrence after resection were treated. Patients with missing data, metastatic disease and normal serum CA19-9 before IRE were excluded. This left 35 cases for analysis. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe median CA19-9 did not decrease in the cohort after IRE treatment (282 U/ml before versus 315 U/ml after; p=0.80). The 25th percentile of patients with the best CA19-9 response had improved overall survival compared to the 25th percentile with the worst response (mean 13.1 versus 8.1 months, respectively; p=0.01). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIRE did not lower the level of CA19-9 in pancreatic cancer cases. However, a response in CA19-9 was correlated with improved survival. <br>	885	550	10
Hookwire-guided Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Using Contrast-enhanced Ultrasonography Followed by a One-step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) Assay for Breast Cancer.	<b>AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo investigate the feasibility of hookwire-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) followed by a one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClinical T1-2N0M0 breast cancer patients scheduled to undergo SLNB participated in this study. Both Sonazoid® and dye were used as tracers, and the most upstream sentinel lymph node (SLN) at each lymphatic flow detected by CEUS (First-SLN) was sampled under hookwire guidance, a procedure called "Sona-Hook". <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn each of the 50 cases, at least one First-SLN was extracted by "Sona-Hook". All contrast-enhanced SLNs (CE-SLNs) were dye-positive, and the mean number of CE-SLNs sampled per patient was lower than that of dye-positive SLNs (1.48 vs. 1.88, p<0.01). Through OSNA, qualitative assessment of tumor metastasis between First-SLNs and all SLNs completely matched together. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Sona-Hook" for First-SLN followed by an OSNA assay may be a feasible minimally invasive SLNB strategy. <br>	840	498	8
Suppression of Carnosine on Adhesion and Extravasation of Human Colorectal Cancer Cells.	<b>AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo investigate the effect of carnosine, an active compound of dietary beef, fish and chicken, on the regulation of cell adhesion and extravasation during metastasis. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCell adhesion and extravasation abilities, and related regulating molecular mechanisms were analyzed in human colorectal cancer cells (HCT-116) and human umbilical vein cells (EA.hy926). <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCarnosine reduced the ability of HCT-116 cells to adhere to EA.hy926 cells. The expression levels of integrin-β1 in HCT-116 cells, as well as of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin in EA.hy926 cells, were reduced after carnosine treatment. After EA.hy926 cells were treated with carnosine, phosphorylation of vascular endothelia-cadherin (VE-cadherin), protein levels of Ras homologous (RHO) and RHO-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase, and levels of reactive oxygen species were reduced. After treating EA.hy926 cells with carnosine, phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were reduced. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCarnosine inhibits metastatic cell adhesion and extravasation by suppressing NF-κB signaling activation. <br>	984	495	7
Level of Melanotransferrin in Tissue and Sera Serves as a Prognostic Marker of Gastric Cancer.	<b>AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of the study was to identify novel biomarkers that are vital for improving management of patients with gastric cancer (GC). <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn RNA-sequencing analysis was conducted using gastric tissue from patients with metastatic GC. In vitro cell functions were evaluated by siRNA-mediated knockdown assays. A total of 230 pairs of gastric tissue were subjected to expression analysis of mRNA and protein in situ. The serum levels of the candidate biomarker were determined by ELISA. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMELTF was identified as a candidate biomarker. Inhibition of MELTF expression suppressed the invasion ability of GC cells. Increased tissue MELTF mRNA expression was associated with shorter survival. Furthermore, staining intensity of tissue MELTF protein was linked to recurrence rates. Serum MELTF levels gradually were increased from healthy controls to advanced GC. Patients with high serum MELTF levels had poor prognosis. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBoth tissue and serum MELTF levels may serve as biomarkers of GC progression. <br>	840	478	12
Shikonin-induced Apoptosis of Colon Cancer Cells Is Reduced by Peroxiredoxin V Expression.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspColon cancer is the second most common deadliest malignancy in the world and better understanding of its underlying mechanisms is needed to improve clinical management. Natural plant extracts are gaining attention in the development of new therapeutic strategies against various cancer types. Shikonin is a naturally extracted naphthoquinone pigment with effects against cancer, including colon cancer. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this study, we conducted a series of in vitro experiments to show the effects of Shikonin on colon cancer cell apoptosis. A colon cancer cell line with overexpression of peroxiredoxin V (PrxV) was constructed and the relationship of PrxV expression with Shikonin-induced cell apoptosis was investigated. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShikonin induced colon cancer cell apoptosis via regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Shikonin-induced cell apoptosis was abrogated by overexpression of PrxV. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAccording to the results obtained in this study, targeting PrxV may provide new insight for the successful management of colon cancer by inducing cell apoptosis. <br>	902	535	8
Bis(4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one) Coumarin Induces Apoptosis in MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells Through Aromatase Inhibition.	<b>AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe present investigation aimed to examine the therapeutic potential of the new coumarin derivative bis(4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one) coumarin (4HC) against breast cancer. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor this purpose, the effects of 4HC treatment on the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and on MCF-10a non-cancerous cells were evaluated using a fluorescent assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were measured by image cytometry. The expression level of aromatase (CYP19A1) and apoptosis-related genes were determined by real-time PCR. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMCF-7 mammary cancer cell proliferation was significantly decreased within 24 h after treatment with 4HC at 50 μM, while no effect was observed on the viability of MCF-10a non-cancerous mammary cells. 4HC also increased the percentage of the cells in the G2/M phase, inducing apoptosis. Real-time PCR revealed that 4HC induced MCF-7 mortality through an up-regulation of Bax and a down-regulation of Bcl-2, resulting in an increase in caspase-3 gene expression. The increased expression of apoptosis-related genes was accompanied by a decrease in CYP19A1 gene expression. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4HC selectively inhibits proliferation of MCF-7cells in vitro. Moreover, 4HC has inhibitory effects on aromatase gene expression and promoting effects on apoptosis, in MCF-7 cells. <br>	1097	583	10
Evaluation and Clinical Significance of Jagged-1-activated Notch Signaling by APEX1 in Colorectal Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common in the world and its prevalence is rapidly increasing. Jagged-1-activated Notch signaling by apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APEX1) promotes CRC, and high expression of Jagged-1 is associated with poor prognosis. However, its clinical implication is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical role of Jagged-1-activated Notch signaling by APEX1. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to evaluate the anti-cancer efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Tissue from CRC patients was analyzed to assess the clinical specificity of Jagged-1 activated by APEX1. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in cells co-expressing APEX1 and Jagged-1 cells was higher than that in cells expressing only APEX1. These results indicated that the simultaneous expression of APEX1 and Jagged-1 might be associated with chemoresistance toward 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Analysis of tissue from CRC patients revealed that high expression of Jagged-1 was associated with a statistically significantly low response to chemotherapy. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOverexpression of Jagged-1 by APEX1 might serve as a predictor of response to chemotherapy and of poor prognosis, and moreover may be a therapeutic target for chemotherapy of advanced CRC. <br>	1183	665	10
Oncolytic Effect of Adenoviruses Serotypes 5 and 6 Against U87 Glioblastoma Cancer Stem Cells.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOncolytic adenoviruses are promising therapeutic agents against both the bulk of tumor cells and cancer stem cells. The present study intended to test the oncolytic capability of adenovirus serotype 6 (Ad6), which has a lower seroprevalence and hepatotoxicity relatively to adenovirus 5 (Ad5), against the glioblastoma and its cancer stem cells. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOncolytic efficacy of Ad6 was compared to widespread Ad5 both in vitro and in vivo, using the U87 and U251 human glioblastoma cell lines and subcutaneously transplanted U87 cells in SCID mice, respectively. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAd6 had a dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward glioblastoma cells in vitro and its intratumoral injections lead to a significant (p<0.05) decrease in volume of U87 xenografts, similarly to Ad5. Based on the innate capability of glioblastoma cancer stem cells to internalize a fluorescent-labeled double-stranded DNA probe, the spatial localization of these cells was estimated and it was shown that the number of cancer stem cells tended to decrease under adenovirus therapy as compared to the control group. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAd6 was shown to be a promising agent for treating glioblastomas. <br>	959	570	6
Expression of Serpin B9 as a Prognostic Factor of Colorectal Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTreatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) does not reflect immune interactions between tumours and macro-organisms. Serpin B9 is known as an inhibitor of Granzyme B. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the expression of Serpin B9 in CRC and healthy colon tissue on prognosis. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis retrospective study included 74 CRC patients in all stages. Analysis of gene expression was performed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription using specific primers and master mix Xceed qPCR SG. Expression was normalized to the reference genes GAPDH, ACTB, and PSMC. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIncreased expression of Serpin B9 in healthy tissue was significantly associated with longer overall survival (OS). This association was found both in all patients and in the group of patients with distant metastases. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe presented results support previous evidence of positive influence of the interaction between immune system and tumour on the prognosis of CRC. <br>	812	510	9
Effects of Volatile Anesthetics on Proliferation and Viability of SW480 Colon Cancer Cells In Vitro.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor patients undergoing cancer surgery, the risk for cancer progression is enhanced during the perioperative period. To what extent the type of anesthetic can affect the metastatic process and finally the outcome of patients with cancer is under debate. For this reason, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the volatile anesthetics sevoflurane and desflurane on colon cancer cells in vitro. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSW480 colon carcinoma cells were exposed for 3 or 6 h to sevoflurane (1 or 2.5 vol%) or desflurane (6 or 12 vol%). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry after a 24-72 h recovery and apoptosis was detected by annexin V staining after a 0-48 h recovery. Viability was tested by measuring ATP content after 0 and 24 h recovery. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTreatment with sevoflurane or desflurane caused no or only slight changes in cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis rate. Desflurane at 12vol% significantly reduced cell viability by 17±25% and 11±22% after 3 and 6 h incubation and 24 h recovery, respectively, while 2.5 vol% sevoflurane slightly increased viability. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt clinically relevant concentrations, sevoflurane and desflurane had only slight effects on SW480 colon cancer cells in vitro. <br>	1011	667	9
In Vitro Study of the Anti-cancer Effect of Alternate-day 5-Fluorouracil in Head and Neck Cancer Cells.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe have previously reported that alternate-day S-1 had comparable effects and milder adverse events than the respective consecutive-day regimen in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer effects of both regimens and underlying mechanisms in vitro. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwo head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines were treated with 5-FU given on an alternate-day or consecutive-day schedule. The relative inhibition (RI) of tumor growth was calculated. Cell cycle distributions and cyclin expression following 5-FU treatment were analyzed. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe RI of both regimens was almost identical. The percentage of cells in S phase was significantly increased in the alternate-day group compared to the consecutive-day group (p<0.001). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe cytotoxic effect of alternate-day was equivalent to that of consecutive-day. S-phase arrest was more prominently observed with the alternate-day regimen, which may help maintain 5-FU sensitivity in head and neck cancer cells. <br>	860	523	9
Integrated Small Dense Low-density Lipoprotein Profile in Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer: A Longitudinal Study.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLow-density lipoproteins (LDL) are a heterogeneous class of particles that differ in size and density from each other. Small dense LDL (sdLDL) particles are considered more atherogenic than larger particles. The aim of the study was to evaluate serum levels of sdLDL in patients who died from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or cancer in a cohort of patients followed up in the De Bellis Research Hospital for 20 years. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA total of 75 participants who died of cancer and 87 who died of CVD were enrolled and they were matched for age and sex with 135 healthy controls, i.e. without CVD or cancer and are still alive. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPatients who died from cancer had the highest value of LDL IV subfraction (0.25±1.16), followed by those who died from CVD (0.17±0.96). <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe integrated profile of sdLDL between CVD and cancer suggests that therapeutic modulation of sdLDL may be associated with a risk reduction for these diseases. <br>	762	568	6
Combination of Trabectedin With Oxaliplatinum and 5-Fluorouracil Arrests a Primary Colorectal Cancer in a Patient-derived Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the present study, we aimed to determine the efficacy of trabectedin (TRAB) combined with oxaliplatinum (OXA)+5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on a colorectal cancer (CRC) patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse model. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA patient CRC tumor previously established in nude mice was implanted subcutaneously in transgenic green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing nude mice. Harvested tumor fragments were transplanted orthotopically in non-transgenic nude mice. Mice were randomized into three groups: Group 1 (G1), untreated-control; Group 2 (G2), OXA+5-FU; Group 3 (G3), TRAB+OXA+5-FU. Tumor width, length, and mouse body weight were measured twice a week. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBoth treatment groups inhibited tumor growth compared to the untreated control group. The combination of TRAB, OXA and 5-FU was significantly more efficacious than OXA+5-FU and arrested tumor growth. No significant changes were observed in body-weight in any of the three groups. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTRAB, OXA and 5-FU combination has clinical potential for this and other CRC patients. <br>	886	537	9
Antiproliferative Effect of Lenvatinib on Human Liver Cancer Cell Lines In Vitro and In Vivo.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLenvatinib is a potent inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases, targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1-4), KIT, and RET. Here, we investigated the antiproliferative effects of lenvatinib in liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEleven hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and two combined hepatocellular/cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were treated with 0-30 μM lenvatinib. Cell growth, apoptosis and the expression of FGFR1-4, FGF19, fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate (FRS)2α and RET were examined. Two HCC cell lines were subcutaneously implanted on nude mice and mice were treated with 3, 10, 30 mg/kg/day of lenvatinib or vehicle for 14 consecutive days. Tumor volume was measured every 3 days. Mice were sacrificed on day 15 and tumors were processed for histological examination. Blood vessels, microvessel density, necrosis, and apoptosis were also examined. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLenvatinib dose- and time-dependently inhibited growth of all cell lines; however, sensitivity to lenvatinib varied. Apoptosis was not observed in any cell line, and expression of FGFR1, -2, -3 and -4, FGF19, FRS2α, and RET were observed in these cell lines. Cell lines with high expression of these factors showed higher response to lenvatinib. In mice, lenvatinib dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth. Blood vessels and microvessel density were significantly reduced and the rate of necrosis was significantly increased by lenvatinib; apoptosis was not observed. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAntiproliferative effects of lenvatinib on liver cancer cells were observed in vitro and in vivo. Lenvatinib may suppress tumor formation by inhibiting angiogenesis, and via an additional direct antiproliferative effect in some liver cancer cells. <br>	1514	768	15
Identification of Matrix Metalloproteinase 11 as a Prognostic Biomarker in Pancreatic Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of this study was to investigate matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11) as a promising biomarker in human pancreatic cancer. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA consecutive eliminating method was used to select biomarker candidates in pancreatic cancer. mRNA and protein expression levels of candidates were determined in tissues and whole blood samples of healthy donors and pancreatic cancer patients. The prognostic value of MMP11 was determined using various data-sets and Liptak's Z analysis. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnalysis using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database showed significantly higher MMP11 mRNA expression in pancreatic cancer tissues compared to that in various normal tissues. MMP11 protein was specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues, but not in various normal or other cancer tissues. Secreted MMP11 levels could be measured using easily accessible techniques and whole blood samples of pancreatic cancer. In addition, high levels of MMP11 were associated with poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMMP11 may be a promising prognostic biomarker for pancreatic cancer patients. <br>	918	486	9
Increased Immunosuppression Is Related to Increased Amounts of Ascites and Inferior Prognosis in Ovarian Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe presence of ascites in ovarian cancer patients is considered a negative prognostic factor. The underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe amount of ascites was evaluated, preferably, using diffusion-weighted MRI at primary diagnosis in a retrospective cohort of 214 women with ovarian cancer, in an ordinal manner (amount of ascites: none, limited, moderate, abundant). In a prospective cohort comprising 45 women with ovarian cancer, IL-10 (interleukin), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), TGF-β (transforming growth factor) and CCL-2 [chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2] were measured at diagnosis (and at interval debulking, when available). <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGradually increasing amounts of ascites were correlated significantly, even after correction for FIGO stage, with reduced survival (p<0.0001) and stronger immunosuppression (IL10 and VEGF). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduced immunosuppression, which was observed as a reduction in CCL-2, IL-10 and VEGF. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe amount of ascites is an independent predictor of survival and correlates with increased immunosuppression. <br>	934	510	7
Efficacy of Afatinib and Lapatinib Against HER2 Gene-amplified Trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant Human Gastric Cancer Cells.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTrastuzumab is the only clinically approved targeted therapy for HER2 gene-amplified gastric cancer at present. However, the clinical significance of multi-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in HER2-positive gastric cancer remains unclear. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe examined the anti-tumor activity of lapatinib and afatinib, that are reversible and irreversible TKIs, in HER2 gene-amplified trastuzumab-sensitive and - resistant gastric cancer cells (GLM-1 and GLM-1HerR2) in vitro and in vivo. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfatinib inhibited the growth of GLM-1 and GLM-1HerR2 cells in vitro more efficiently than lapatinib by inducing G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Preclinical studies in mice revealed that afatinib inhibited growth of intraperitoneal GLM-1 and subcutaneous GLM-1HerR2 tumor more strongly than lapatinib. Afatinib was more effective than lapatinib in blocking PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling in both GLM-1 and GLM-1HerR2 cells. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfatinib could be a potential new molecular-targeted therapy for trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant HER2 gene-amplified gastric cancers. <br>	921	497	7
Double-negative T Cells Inhibit Proliferation and Invasion of Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells in Co-culture.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDouble-negative T (DNT) cells are phenotypically CD3+CD4-CD8-T cells. This study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer activity of DNT cells against pancreatic cancer cells. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDNT cells were isolated from human peripheral blood. The effect of DNT cells on proliferation and invasion of the human pancreatic cell line Panc-1 was assessed. Expression of Nrf2 and Fas in Panc-1 cells co-cultured with DNT cells was analyzed with RT-PCR. The supernatants of Panc-1 and DNT co-cultures were analyzed with ELISA for IFN-r and FasL levels. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe isolated DNT cell phenotype was CD4-CD8-CD56- CD3+TCR (T cell receptor) α/β+ T cells with more than 90% purity. Panc-1 cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by co-culture with DNT cells. Panc-1 cells co-cultured with DNT cells showed significantly reduced cell invasion. Panc-1 cells co-cultured with DNT cells showed increased Nrf2 and Fas mRNA expression. Increased INF-r and FasL levels were detected in the supernatants of co-cultures of DNT and pancreatic cells. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDNT cells inhibited proliferation and invasion of human pancreatic cancer cells. The INF-r, Fas/FasL pathway and Nrf2 may be involved in the anti-cancer effect of DNT cells against human pancreatic cancer. <br>	1038	601	13
Tissue Expression of Melanoma-associated Antigen A6 and Clinical Characteristics of Gastric Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGastric cancer (GC) exhibits heterogeneous clinical and molecular features, requiring the development of new biomarkers to further understand this disease. Our transcriptomic analysis detected overexpression of melanoma-associated antigen A6 (MAGEA6) in metastatic GC, leading us to determine the clinical significance of MAGEA6 in GC. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFourteen GC cell lines and 230 pairs of surgically resected gastric tissues were subjected to mRNA expression analysis. Polymerase chain reaction array analysis was performed to identify coordinately expressed cancer-related genes, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detected MAGEA6 expression in situ. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMAGEA6 mRNA levels were positively correlated with the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 mRNA. MAGEA6 mRNA levels were higher in GC tissues compared with those in normal adjacent tissues. Patients with high MAGEA6 expression had significantly worse prognosis. MAGEA6 protein levels in primary lesions predicted the likelihood of recurrence. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOverexpression of MAGEA6 in GC tissues represents a promising biomarker for assessing the malignant phenotype of GC. <br>	963	514	9
Lopinavir-Ritonavir Combination Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Kills Urological Cancer Cells.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInduction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a novel approach to cancer treatment. This study investigated the ability of the clinically feasible combination of the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir to induce ER stress killing urological cancer cells. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRenal cancer cells (769-P, 786-O) and bladder cancer cells (UMUC-3, T-24) were used to investigate the ability of the combination to induce ER stress and its mechanism of action. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe combination inhibited the growth of both renal and bladder cancer cells synergistically by inducing ER stress. The combination-induced ER stress increased the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase and suppressed the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. It also increased the expression of a tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor and thereby sensitized the cancer cells to TRAIL. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe combination of lopinavir and ritonavir acts against urological cancer cells by inducing ER stress synergistically. <br>	879	497	7
Cytoplasmic Mineralocorticoid Receptor Expression Predicts Dismal Local Relapse-free Survival in Non-triple-negative Breast Cancer.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of the study was to investigate the prognostic role of androgen receptor (AR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor β (GRβ) expression in HER-2 negative breast cancer patients. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe study population (n=152) was enriched with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) (n=96; 63.2%). The median follow-up time was 100 months. AR, MR and GRβ immunocytochemical staining was compared with that of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (vimentin, SIP1, ZEB1). <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHigh expression of cytoplasmic MR was associated with dismal local relapse-free survival (RR=13.923; 95%CI=1.071-181.045; p=0.044) in tumours with non-TNBC phenotype. AR and GRβ were more frequently expressed in ER+/PR+/HER2- tumours, while cytoplasmic MR was more often expressed in TNBC tumours (for all, p<0.0005). GRβ and AR were associated with decreased vimentin expression (p<0.005), indicating their association with attenuated EMT. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCytoplasmic MR expression is a strong predictor of local recurrence in non-metastatic breast cancer patients with non-TNBC tumour phenotype. <br>	931	523	8
Clonal Evolution of MEK/MAPK Pathway Activating Mutations in a Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Case.	<b>BACKGROUND/AIM:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe aim of this study was to examine clonal heterogeneity, to test the utility of liquid biopsy in monitoring disease progression and to evaluate the usefulness of ex vivo drug screening in a BRAF L597Q-mutated colorectal cancer (CRC) patient developing metastases during adjuvant therapy. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNext generation sequencing (NGS) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were performed in samples from tumor tissues and liquid biopsies. Live cancer cells from a metastatic lesion were used in ex vivo drug sensitivity assays. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe found evidence of continued dependence of MEK/MAPK pathway activation, but different activating mutations in primary tumor and metastases. Liquid biopsy based BRAF L597Q ddPCR testing was a sensitive personalized biomarker predicting the rise of clinically aggressive metastatic disease. Ex vivo drug sensitivity assays with BRAF L597Q mutated cells showed response to MEK/MAPK targeted therapies. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe rare BRAF L597Q mutation may be associated with aggressive tumor behavior in CRC. Liquid biopsy can be used to capture clinically relevant tumor features. <br>	916	515	8
Association of Genetic Ancestry With DNA Methylation Changes in Prostate Cancer Disparity.	<b>BACKGROUND:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe hypothesized that ancestry-mediated methylated DNA changes may drive racial and ethnic disparity in prostate cancer (PCa). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genetic ancestry and association with DNA methylation changes in PCa disparity. <br><b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPyrosequencing and ancestry informative markers were used for DNA methylation and genetic ancestry testing, respectively. <br><b>RESULTS:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing Spearman rho rank correlation test, the data demonstrated significant (p<0.05) and variable association between African-American ancestry and DNA methylation for all genes investigated in prostate tissues. <br><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGenetic ancestry influences DNA methylation and this modifying factor must be considered in epigenetic association studies in populations of admixed patients. <br>	643	356	5
Lysine-specific demethylase 1 mediates AKT activity and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer.	Activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program is a critical mechanism for initiating cancer progression and migration. Colorectal cancers (CRCs) contain many genetic and epigenetic alterations that can contribute to EMT. Mutations activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway are observed in >40% of patients with CRC contributing to increased invasion and metastasis. Little is known about how oncogenic signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT synergize with chromatin modifiers to activate the EMT program. Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and enhances cell migration. In this study we determine that LSD1 expression is significantly elevated in CRC patients with mutation of the catalytic subunit of PI3K, PIK3CA, compared to CRC patients with WT PIK3CA. LSD1 enhances activation of the AKT kinase in CRC cells through a non-catalytic mechanism, acting as a scaffolding protein for the transcription-repressing CoREST complex. Additionally, growth of PIK3CA mutant CRC cells is uniquely dependent on LSD1. Knockdown or CRISPR knockout of LSD1 blocks AKT-mediated stabilization of the EMT-promoting transcription factor Snail and effectively blocks AKT-mediated EMT and migration. Overall we uniquely demonstrate that LSD1 mediates AKT activation in response to growth factors and oxidative stress, and LSD1-regulated AKT activity promotes EMT-like characteristics in a subset of PIK3CA mutant cells. Implications: Our data supports the hypothesis that inhibitors targeting the CoREST complex may be clinically effective in CRC patients harboring PIK3CA mutations. <br>	1438	245	11
Genomic characteristics of triple-negative breast cancer nominate molecular subtypes that predict chemotherapy response.	The heterogeneity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses difficulties for suitable treatment and leads to poor outcome. This study aimed to define a consensus molecular subtype (CMS) of TNBC and thus elucidate genomic characteristics and relevant therapy. We integrated the expression profiles of 957 TNBC samples from published datasets. We identified genomic characteristics of subtype by exploring the pathway activity, microenvironment, and clinical relevance. Additionally, drug response (DR) scores (n = 181) were computationally investigated using chemical perturbation gene signatures and evaluated in our own TNBC patient (n = 38) who received chemotherapy and organoid biobank data (n = 64). Subsequently, cooperative functions with drugs were also explored. Finally, we classified TNBC into four CMSs: stem-like; mesenchymal-like; immunomodulatory; luminal-androgen receptor (AR). CMSs also elucidated distinct tumor-associated microenvironment and pathway activities. Furthermore, we discovered metastasis-promoting genes, such as secreted phosphoprotein 1 by comparing with primary. Computational DR scores associated with CMS revealed drug candidates (n = 18) and it was successfully validated in cisplatin response of both patients and organoids. Our CMS recapitulated in-depth functional and cellular heterogeneity encompassing primary and metastatic TNBC. We suggest DR scores to predict CMS-specific drug responses and to be successfully validated. Finally, our approach systemically proposes a relevant therapeutic prediction model as well as prognostic markers for TNBC. Implications: We delineated the genomic characteristic and computational drug responses prediction for TNBC CMS from gene expression profile. Our systematic approach provides diagnostic markers for subtype and metastasis verified by machine-learning and novel therapeutic candidates for TNBC patients. <br>	1654	258	15

SNHG14 stimulates cell autophagy to facilitate cisplatin resistance of colorectal cancer by regulating miR-186/ATG14 axis.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor with a high incidence and death rate in the world. Molecular interactions inside cells or tissues during tumor occurrence, development, and drug resistance are important for disease prevention and treatment. The long non-coding RNA SNHG14 has been proven to exert its oncogenic function in multiple cancers. However, there is no study regarding the role of SNHG14 in CRC research. In the present study, we applied RT-qPCR and western blot to determine the gene expression levels. MTT and TUNEL assays were used to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis rate. Cell migration and invasion abilities were determined by wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. StarBase was used to predict the potential binding sites and luciferase reporter assay was applied to confirm the direct interactions. Besides, we conducted a xenograft experiment to detect tumor growth rate in vivo. Our results showed that SNHG14 and ATG14 were both significantly higher in CRC tumor tissues than the normal ones, while miR-186 was decreased. The similar results were also observed in CRC cell lines. We confirmed that SNHG14 could directly interact with miR-186 and inhibited its expression. Meanwhile, miR-186 could directly bind ATG14 to inhibit its expression level. In vitro experiments showed that higher expression of SNHG14 led to higher cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while miR-186 significantly inhibited these tumor phenotypes. Furthermore, overexpression of ATG14 could strongly recover the CRC phenotypes attenuated by shSNHG14 or miR-186 mimics. Interestingly, we constructed cisplatin-resistant CRC cells and found that overexpression of ATG14 significantly enhanced the cell proliferation rate and inhibited cell apoptosis. Our research indicated that the novel axis of SNHG14/miR-186/ATG14 could play a vital role in regulating CRC cell progression. Moreover, this axis showed its clinical potential in regulating cisplatin resistance during CRC treatment. <br>	1728	307	18
